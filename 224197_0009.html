            permanent, while to him it is an intcresting episode. She returns to her <br id="r1l9">
            
            village where she witnesses the tragic death of a young woman, Who has <br id="r1l10">
            
            thrown herseif away for sensuous pleasures. This clarifies her views. <br id="r1l11">
            
            Kneeling at this death bed, she knew that she was not one of those who, <br id="r1l12">
            
            endowed with a frivolous nature, are permitted to drink the joys of life <br id="r1l13">
            
            without hesitation. <br id="r1l14">
            
            A novelette, Lieutenant Gustl’ (’0l), relates the monologue of the <br id="r1l15">
            
            officer of that name on the night before his ducl. Against his wishes he <br id="r1l16">
            
            finds it necessary to attend a concert, which becomes an ordeal to him. <br id="r1l17">
            
            Exasperating incidents at the check room threaten to upset his temper <br id="r1l18">
            
            completely, when a master baker seizes his arm and whispers into his car, <br id="r1l19">
            
            If you do not behave I shall draw your sword, break it, and send it to your <br id="r1l20">
            
            regiment. Do you understand, you foolish boy.' The conditions make <br id="r1l21">
            
            immediate retaliation impossible, and Gustl’s honor is compromised a <br id="r1l22">
            
            second time. Since the baker may tell the episode, Gustl feels that he <br id="r1l23">
            
            must obey the code and commit suicide. For fifty pages we follow the <br id="r1l24">
            
            disjointed ante-mortem mutterings of this platitudinous officer. Finally he <br id="r1l25">
            
            makes up his mind that he might as well eat breakfast before his suicide, <br id="r1l26">
            
            and enters a restaurant, where by accident he learns that the master baker <br id="r1l27">
            
            who has insulted him has died during the night. Beside himself with joy <br id="r1l28">
            
            Gustl now proceeds to the barracks for his day’s service, with the resolve <br id="r1l29">
            
            to’pound his adversary to pulp’ in his duel. This novelette is deservedly <br id="r1l30">
            
            popular, because it gives a clear insight into the life of a considerable number <br id="r1l31">
            
            of Vienna officers. During the reading of these broken sentences one is in <br id="r1l32">
            
            constant danger of feeling bored, but at the end one is amazed at the vivid¬ <br id="r1l33">
            
            ness of the picture which the author has conveyed. Unconsciously the <br id="r1l34">
            
            reader enters upon all of the thoughts and interests of this man. <br id="r1l35">
            
            Under the collective title, Living Hours,' four one-act plays were <br id="r1l36">
            
            published in °02. They discuss certain phases of the psychology of fin-de¬ <br id="r1l37">
            
            siecle winters. The first play, the name of which applies to the whole <br id="r1l38">
            
            series, consists of a dialogue between Anton Hausdorfer, a pensioned official, <br id="r1l39">
            
            and Heinrich, a literary man. Heinrich’s mother, an invalid, commits <br id="r1l40">
            
            suicide because she feels that she is a burden to her son. This sacrifice is <br id="r1l41">
            
            accepted by Heinrich rather too lightly. Anton has enjoyed the friendship <br id="r1l42">
            
            of Heinrich’s mother and feels the cruelty of the young man. With pa¬ <br id="r1l43">
            
            tience and calmness he analyzes Heinrich’s attitude and points with re¬ <br id="r1l44">
            
            signed sorrow to the living hours’ that have been sacrificed to his literary <br id="r1l45">
            
            ambition. <br id="r1l46">
            
            The Woman with the Dagger’ shows how a dream may clarify the <br id="r1l47">
            
            troubled mind of the dreamer. Pauline is married to a dramatist, who is <br id="r1l48">
