            there is an honourable aspect to this modern catholicity. We are determined to lose <br id="r1l5">
            
            nothing worth holding ofthe heritage of the past. <br id="r1l6">
            
            Even in the case of the Bible, where selection is hardest, the process is becoming <br id="r1l7">
            
            popular. Books of selection are appearing, sometimes the basis of choice being <br id="r1l8">
            
            literary beauty, sometimes religious import. The two qualities, however, are not <br id="r1l9">
            
            separate. Excellence of style and dignity of contents frequently go hand-inchand in <br id="r1l10">
            
            the Scriptures. Hence it is that we welcome so cordially the new-born zeal for the <br id="r1l11">
            
            literary study of the Bible. What we want is that the Bible should be admired and <br id="r1l12">
            
            loved. Let men enjoy its poetry, praise its eloquence, realise its artistic merits. <br id="r1l13">
            
            Literary appreciation must carry with it moral appreciation; its style cannot be <br id="r1l14">
            
            admired without its contents becoming an inspiration. <br id="r1l15">

            The American Jewish Year Book is edited this year by Dr. Herbert <br id="r1l17">
            
            Friedenwald, Secretary of the American Jewish Committee. The volume is <br id="r1l18">
            
            issued by the Jewish Publication Society of America. <br id="r1l19">
            
            In dialogue form Dr. A. Flesch has published“ Der Jude.“ The author is <br id="r1l20">
            
            Rabbi in the Hungarian congregation of Mohacs, and the parties to the <br id="r1l21">
            
            dialogue are an old-fashioned pietist and a modernised child of Judaism and <br id="r1l22">
            
            the world. The latter gets the best of the argumen; that was the author’s <br id="r1l23">
            
            purpose, of course. It is noticeable that there has been of late a revival in <br id="r1l24">
            
            the liberal camp on the continent. The party has now its organ, a monthly <br id="r1l25">
            
            called Liberales Judentum, which is edited by Dr. Seligmann in Frankfort¬ <br id="r1l26">
            
            on-the-Main. It is published bythe“ Vereinigung für das liberale Judentum <br id="r1l27">
            
            in Deutschland. <br id="r1l28">
            
            The new number of Freimann’s Hebrdische Bibliographie has a good <br id="r1l29">
            
            account by Dr. S. Poznanski of the Book-lists found in the Cambridge Geniza. <br id="r1l30">
            
            Inthe same number, Dr. Porges (of Leipzig), in a discussion of the term <br id="r1l31">
            
            Mumar (Woit) as a term for renegade, connects this word with Marrano, <br id="r1l32">
            
            thus offering a new etymology for the latter. Dr. Poznanski, by the way, is <br id="r1l33">
            
            to edit the publications of the revived Society of" Mekitze Nirdamim,' whose <br id="r1l34">
            
            London representative is to be Dr. Büchler. This is one ofthe best results <br id="r1l35">

            * The Reflections of Lichtenberg'’ is not a new novel by Elinor Glyn. <br id="r1l37">
            
            It is a selection of thoughts (published at half-a-crown by Swan Sonnen¬ <br id="r1l38">
            
            schein) by George C. Lichtenberg, who was born at Darmstadt in 1742 and <br id="r1l39">
            
            died in his fiftv-seventh year. A scientist and satirist, and a sceptic to boot, <br id="r1l40">
            
            he said (speaking in the third person, in a self-character-sketch):“ It is not <br id="r1l41">
            
            beyond him to pray with fervour, and he has never been able to read the <br id="r1l42">
            
            90th Psalm without an indescribable feeling ef exaltation.“ The present <br id="r1l43">
            
            volume is well deseribed by the translator, Norman Alliston, as a“ hotch¬ <br id="r1l44">
            
            potch of aphorisms, thoughts, criticisms, witticisms and the like.“ They are <br id="r1l45">
            
            often commonplace enough, but more often are clever and sometimes are <br id="r1l46">
            
            profound. Here are a few sentences: “ Where moderation is a fault <br id="r1l47">
            
            indifference is a crime.'—“ Perhaps in time to come the so-called Dark Ages <br id="r1l48">
            
            may include own own.'’—“I have frequently been reproached for committing <br id="r1l49">
            
            faults which my censurers had neither the power nor the intelligence to <br id="r1l50">
            
            contmit.“ Perhaps Lichtenberg’s most famous epigram (popularised by <br id="r1l51">
            
            Schopenhauer) is this:" God created man in his own image. This <br id="r1l52">
            
            probably means that man created Ged in his.“ Here, again, is a very subtle <br id="r1l53">
            
            remark:“ We are a great deal more certain that our will is free than that <br id="r1l54">
            
            everyching that happens is bound to have a cause. This being the case, could <br id="r1l55">
            
            we not, for once in a way, reverse the argument, and say: Dur ideas of cause <br id="r1l56">
            
            andeffect must be very inaccurate, for were they right, our will could not be <br id="r1l57">
            
            free? <br id="r1l58">
            
            „ This, too, is a good remark, with much truth init:“ In general, <br id="r1l59">
            
            men find it more diflicult to believe in miracles than in traditions of miracles; <br id="r1l60">
            
            Mles auertHr- <br id="r2l1">
            
            * Perhaps,“ he says,“it is only because Tam getting older, perhaps because 1 <br id="r2l2">
            
            read so much about Zionism and all that; but I can't helpit, I would like to <br id="r2l3">
            
            see Jerusalem before 1 die.“ <br id="r2l4">
            
            In this house, where the vain mother and daughter, with their leanings <br id="r2l5">
            
            to the Christians, have the upper hand, grew up the son of the house, Oskar <br id="r2l6">
            
            Ehrenberg, Lieutenant of Reserve, a revolting Jewish snob, who, for fear of <br id="r2l7">
            
            being disinherited, will not get baptised, but ostentationsly takes off his hat <br id="r2l8">
            
            in front of every Catholic Church, and, on one occasion, gets : box on the <br id="r2l9">
            
            ears from his father for the offence. This house, too, is visited b., t#e Jewish <br id="r2l10">
            
            author, Heinrich Bermann, a splendidly depicted type of that self-centred, <br id="r2l11">
            
            uncertain Jewish poet-mind which is always uneasy,“ because it always <br id="r2l12">
            
            finds itself on hostile soil.' This perpetually brooding, painfully doubting <br id="r2l13">
            
            man, gives expression to his feelings in words which will find an echo in <br id="r2l14">
            
            every intelligent Jewish heart. Speaking to his friend, Baron Georg, he says: <br id="r2l15">
            
            Do you believe that there is a Christian on earth, no matter how noble, just and <br id="r2l16">
            
            true he may be. who would not, in a moment of temper, ill-humour or anger, turn, at <br id="r2l17">
            
            any rate inwardly, against even his best friend. against his wife, if they should be <br id="r2l18">
            
            Jewsor of Jewish origin? There is not one, Tassure you. You can, moreover, make <br id="r2l19">
            
            another test. Read, for example, the letters of any celebrated, otherwise quite clever <br id="r2l20">
            
            and excellent man, and notice the passages containing hostile and ironical <br id="r2l21">
            
            references to contemporaries. In ninet nine cases the individual will be referredto <br id="r2l22">
            
            withont any mention of his origin or religion, but in the hundredth case where the <br id="r2l23">
            
            offending person has the misfortune to be a Jew, the author will certainly not forget <br id="r2l24">
            
            to mention the fact. It is so, and Lcan't help it. <br id="r2l25">
            
            In the course of the subseguent conversation Bermann expresses the <br id="r2l26">
            
            view that there can be no combined solution of the Jewish question, but that <br id="r2l27">
            
            each individual must solve the problem for himself. <br id="r2l28">
            
            In our days there will be no solution; that is absolutely certain. At least no <br id="r2l29">
            
            general solution. Rather will there be a hundred thousand different schutions, <br id="r2l30">
            
            because it is really a matter that for the present each must settle for himself in the <br id="r2l31">
            
            best way he can. Each müst see for himself how he can be extricated from bis <br id="r2l32">
            
            distress, his despair, his miserv wherever he can onco more breathe freely. Perhaps <br id="r2l33">
            
            there are really people who will have to goto Jerusalem. Ionly fear that many <br id="r2l34">
            
            when they have arrived at this common goal will find that thev have made a grievous <br id="r2l35">
            
            mistake, 1 do not for a moment believe that such pilgrimages to freedom can be made <br id="r2l36">
            
            in consort, for the roads thither do not lead out into the land but lie withinus. lt is <br id="r2l37">
            
            for everyone then to lind his inner road. It is, therefore, necessary to look as cleaily <br id="r2l38">
            
            as possible into his own being, to illuminate his most hidden corners, to have the, <br id="r2l39">
            
            courage of his own nature, not to be deceived. Tes, that must be the daily prayer of <br id="r2l40">
            
            every respectable man: Let me not be deceived!“ <br id="r2l41">
            
            Georg thought:" What is theimatter with him? In his way he is as ill as his <br id="r2l42">
            
            father was. But it cannot be said that he has personally had bad experiences. He <br id="r2l43">
            
            once asserted that he feels attached to no-one. That is not true. He feels himself <br id="r2l44">
            
            attached to every Jew, and to the last of them more closely than to me.“ <br id="r2l45">
            
            This is evidently Schnitzler’s view. To this society there belongs also <br id="r2l46">
            
            the Ishmaelite Jewish critie Nuernberger, who is satisfied with nothing in <br id="r2l47">
            
            the world and is alwavs grumbling to himself. Then there is the young Leo <br id="r2l48">
            
            Golowski, an ardent Zionist, who is strengthened in his faith by his bad <br id="r2l49">
            
            treatment in the army, and who, at the expiry of his term of service, shoots <br id="r2l50">
            
            his Lieutenant. In contrast to him is his sister Therese, a Social-Democrat, <br id="r2l51">
            
            who vacillates between free love and political propaganda. There is, further, <br id="r2l52">
            
            the old Jewish physician, Dr. Stauber, whose whole philosophy is expressed <br id="r2l53">
            
            in benevolence, and his son, Dr. Berthold Stauber, who, as a Liberal parlia¬ <br id="r2l54">
            
            mentary deputy, makes the bitter experience that Liberalism in Austria is <br id="r2l55">
            
            played out, and that he, owing to his Judaism, is given the go-by by his party, <br id="r2l56">
            
            and in disgust resigns his seat. <br id="r2l57">
            
            Then there is the real hero of the novel, Baron Georg von Wergenthin, <br id="r2l58">
            
            who devotes himself to music andseeks inspiration in this intellectual Jewish <br id="r2l59">
