            Bahr points out that once a Catholic always <br id="r2l3">
            
            a Catholic; in his youth he strayed from <br id="r2l4">
            
            the church, but an inexorable law has com¬ <br id="r2l5">
            
            pelled him back to its gorgeous pomp and <br id="r2l6">
            
            ritual, above all, to its disciplined faith; <br id="r2l7">
            
            and it is this deep faith which has re¬ <br id="r2l8">
            
            knitted him to the mild sweetness and <br id="r2l9">

            Im contemporary Austrian literature the <br id="r2l11">
            
            writer who sets himself to portray the <br id="r2l12">
            
            swistly flowing life of the city is fully <br id="r2l13">
            
            balanced by the so-called Heimatsdichter, <br id="r2l14">
            
            the singer and poet of the familiar soil. A <br id="r2l15">
            
            good many of the latter, to be sure, write <br id="r2l16">
            
            in prose; but the medium is of secondary <br id="r2l17">
            
            importance; intimacy with the cornlands <br id="r2l18">
            
            and vineyards and forests make of them <br id="r2l19">
            
            poets of the first order. Chief among these <br id="r2l20">
            
            I should put Carl Schönherr, who is known <br id="r2l21">
            
            inthe United States by his Children's <br id="r2l22">
            
            Tragedy, one of his earliest but certainly <br id="r2l23">
            
            not one of his best plays. A far better <br id="r2l24">
            
            piece in this homeland' genre is Erde.) <br id="r2l25">
            
            and only a littie less significant is Glaube <br id="r2l26">
            
            und Heimat.“ The latter is so deeplz <br id="r2l27">
            
            rooted in the mountain life of the Tyrol <br id="r2l28">
            
            that it is unthinkable any translator, how¬ <br id="r2l29">
            
            ever gifted, could carry it over into intelli¬ <br id="r2l30">
            
            gible English prose; the words might be <br id="r2l31">
            
            conveyed, but the spirit and atmosphere <br id="r2l32">
            
            Wotlid remain forever remote and foreign. <br id="r2l33">
            
            It is, as the reader has already guessed, a <br id="r2l34">
            
            play dealing with peasant life, and we have <br id="r2l35">
            
            nothing to correspond to the Austrian <br id="r2l36">
            
            peasant. Then, again, it portrays an aspect <br id="r2l37">
            
            of the anti-Reformation, as exemplified by <br id="r2l38">
            
            one family group in the Austrian Alps; <br id="r2l39">
            
            how, a cluster of stubborn peasants sullenly <br id="r2l40">
            
            clung to the homely creed of their fathers <br id="r2l41">
            
            against all the fierce onslarghts of invad¬ <br id="r2l42">
            
            ing Protestantism.Glaube und Heimat' <br id="r2l43">
            
            is not, however, a religious problem play. <br id="r2l44">
            
            Far from it; the author has used the <br id="r2l45">
            
            Reformation merely as a starting point, but <br id="r2l46">
            
            what he is interested in, above everything <br id="r2l47">
            
            else, is the tenacity of human faith and <br id="r2l48">
            
            profound human illusions. <br id="r2l49">
            
            In Erde' Schönherr has plumbed to the <br id="r2l50">
            
            loamy bottom of the peasant’s soul; and his <br id="r2l51">
            
            vision and seizure are so telling, solbeauti¬ <br id="r2l52">
            
            fully accurate and moving that the effect of <br id="r2l53">
            
            this play cannot be casily put into words. <br id="r2l54">
            
            It is truer to say that Erde' is closer to <br id="r2l55">
            
            a poem# than a play, an unwritten poem <br id="r2l56">
            
            perhaps by some Austrian Wordsworth or <br id="r2l57">
            
            Burns; this is not so paradoxical as it <br id="r2l58">
            
            sonnds, for Schönherr has contented him¬ <br id="r2l59">
            
            self witha noble conception eked out by <br id="r2l60">
            
            penctrating dramatic moments, but the lyric <br id="r2l61">
            
            note is lacking. As drama, howéver, it <br id="r2l62">
            
            leaves very little to be desired. An old <br id="r2l63">
            
            peasant is supposed to be dying by his <br id="r2l64">
            
            son, who begins to think about his inherit¬ <br id="r2l65">
            
            ance and is already preoccupied fashioning <br id="r2l66">
            
            his father’s coffin. But spring comes very <br id="r2l67">
            
            suddenly after a hard, dark winter of the <br id="r2l68">
            
            mountains, and old Grutz, the aged peasant, <br id="r2l69">

            for inexorable consequence. (I do not take <br id="r3l99">
