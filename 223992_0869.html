            A roung man, a student, loves a girl of the humbler <br id="r1l49">

            have died is bitter enough. but that ho should have <br id="r1l54">
            
            died for another woman is unendurable. That is the <br id="r1l55">

            which was exactly right, and we have seldom seen a <br id="r1l59">

            representation. A young fellow named Fritz Lob¬ <br id="r2l25">
            
            heimer has fallen passionately in love with a married <br id="r2l26">
            
            woman. At the same time he is carrying on a toler¬ <br id="r2l27">
            
            ably animated flirtation with a girl called Christine. <br id="r2l28">
            
            The first woman we are not permitted to see, but we <br id="r2l29">
            
            learn that she is of the passionate, full-blooded, and <br id="r2l30">
            
            voluptuous order. Christine, on the other hand, <br id="r2l31">
            
            represents all that is sweet, gentle, and devoted in <br id="r2l32">
            
            womanhood. Presently the injured husband appears <br id="r2l33">
            
            upon the scene. He has discovered his wife’s per¬ <br id="r2l34">
            
            fidy, and nothing short of a duel to the death will <br id="r2l35">
            
            satisfy him. To the proposal Frits, of couree, is <br id="r2l36">
            
            bound to yield assent. Of the coming encounter he <br id="r2l37">

            moment of their final adieu his eyes are opened to <br id="r2l39">
            
            thetruththat it is she whom he really loves: So Fritz <br id="r2l40">
            
            goes forth to his death, and for the last actithere <br id="r2l41">
            
            remains little but the disclosure of the catastrophe <br id="r2l42">
            
            to the broken-hearted Christine, whose griefis ren¬ <br id="r2l43">
            
            dered the more acute by the knowledge that there <br id="r2l44">
            
            was another woman in the case, and that Fritz had <br id="r2l45">

            our interest or our sympathy. Fritz, the hero, is far <br id="r2l52">
