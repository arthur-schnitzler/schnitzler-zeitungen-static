            his last novel, Flight Into Darkness.) <br id="r1l34">
            
            Schnitzler describes the later life and <br id="r1l35">
            
            rnöugnts of à man who is afraid of <br id="r1l36">
            
            going mad. <br id="r1l37">
            
            The story begins when Robert senses <br id="r1l38">
            
            the shadow of a mental disturbance. <br id="r1l39">
            
            Early in life, after brooding over a <br id="r1l40">
            
            friend'’s insanity, Robert had given <br id="r1l41">

            tzing Otto, a physiclan, to kill him <br id="r1l43">
            
            painlessly, should he show signs of <br id="r1l44">
            
            madness. <br id="r1l45">
            
            Robert becomes more abnormal in <br id="r1l46">
            
            action and reasoning. Realizing this, <br id="r1l47">
            
            and no longer wishing to die if he <br id="r1l48">
            
            becomes insane. Robert’s fear that <br id="r1l49">
            
            Otto will kiil him grows into a persecu¬ <br id="r1l50">

            powers of this mania press him to <br id="r1l52">

            * g. sherwood has added decidedly interesting potentialities to a <br id="r2l8">
            
            familiar theme. Elena is one of those occasional women—you will find them <br id="r2l9">
            
            in Russia and half a dozen other European countries—who have had the <br id="r2l10">
            
            youth, imagination and vitality to swim through the revolutionary deluge <br id="r2l11">
            
            that rolled over eastern Europe after the war and to find solid footing in <br id="r2l12">
            
            the new democratic order. Not merely to become “reconciled,“ in a passive <br id="r2l13">
            
            way, but to remake their personalities, their“customs and their codes, and <br id="r2l14">
            
            become active cells in the new regime. <br id="r2l15">
            
            Now suppose the new order, as personified by such a woman, suddenly <br id="r2l16">
            
            to be confanted, in peculiarly persuasive circumstances, with the old life <br id="r2l17">
            
            as persoflified by the man, still young and in no wise fundamentally changed, <br id="r2l18">
            
            with whom she was once in love. Sugebse, in short, Elena, seemingly happy <br id="r2l19">
            
            wife of arfamous and thorough contemporary Viennese psychiatrist, was sud¬ <br id="r2l20">
            
            denly to meet, at a reunion of Austrian emigrés, returned to ceiebrate the <br id="r2l21">
            
            Eirthday of their late Emperor, the tempestuously sentimental, half-mad <br id="r2l22">
            
            Hapsburg prince (lately a taxi driver in Nice) to whom she had once beerr <br id="r2l23">
            
            en ardent mistress. <br id="r2l24">
            
            Here, plainly, is no mere instance of a banal wife straying toward the <br id="r2l25">
            
            roses from the humdrum marital path, but that of a woman of unusual <br id="r2l26">
            
            poise, humor and ripeness of experience (for we must take Elena as Miss <br id="r2l27">
            
            Fontanne presents her in the first scene) armed with a whole complex of¬ <br id="r2l28">
            
            new experiences and acquired ideas and values, suddenly assailed, through <br id="r2l29">
            
            her amorous memories, in the weakest point in that armor. Just what will <br id="r2l30">
            
            happen to it andto her?, It is in this sense that I speak of the “pôtentialities <br id="r2l31">
            
            of Mr. Sherwood’s theme, for they remain that and nothing more. <br id="r2l32">
            
            Vol can easily picture how a Viennese, Schnitzler, for example, might <br id="r2l33">
            
            handle such a theme, how, indeed, he did Händle something of the sort <br id="r2l34">
            
            in that brief episode of The Married Woman' in The Loves of Anatol,“ so <br id="r2l35">
            
            delicately played last winter by Miss Patricia Collinge and persuasively set <br id="r2l36">
            
            by Mr. Jo Meltzer—a late winter afternoon, somewhere along the Prater, <br id="r2l37">
            
            just as the lights were coming on; the bitter-sweet of old Vienna in the mood <br id="r2l38">
            
            and in the scene, the catch in the volce, I-may-not waiting on I-wodld, <br id="r2l39">
            
            snow drifting down on the palace and the stone arcades, tears on the violets. <br id="r2l40">
            
            and so on. Or how Mr. Shaw, the younger Shaw, that is to say, of Arms <br id="r2l41">
            
            and the Man,“ Captain Brassbound,' or “ Caesar and Cleopatra, might <br id="r2l42">
            
            have played with this clash between decadent feudalism and the present age, <br id="r2l43">
            
            romanticism versus rationalism, and what he might have done with this <br id="r2l44">
            
            amorous paranoiac of a princely Hapsburg. <br id="r2l45">
            
            Mr. Sherwood does little or nothing in either vein, but instead scraps <br id="r2l46">
            
            all the theme's possibilities for an incomprehensible bedroom farce, with Mr. <br id="r2l47">
            
            Lunt and Miss Fontanne indulging in some amorous rough-housing, inimi¬ <br id="r2l48">
            
            tably done, to be sure, full of their characteristic vitality and verve, but <br id="r2l49">
            
            empty and disappointing in the circumstances. <br id="r2l50">
            
            Without pang or pain, this recreated Elena, so poised, serene and sure of <br id="r2l51">
            
            herself, and with every air of having come to the emigrés’ reunion per¬ <br id="r2l52">
            
            manently to lay a sentimental ghost, dances into the bedroom of the clownish <br id="r2l53">
            
            Hapsburg (for effervescent as Mr. Lunt’s impersonation is, and peppered <br id="r2l54">
            
            with his characteristic jabs of amusing physical frankness, the röle is frankly <br id="r2l55">
            
            clowned“ thiroughout) and then dances out the bathroom door, leaving, <br id="r2l56">
            
            however, her dress behind her. Then when the mad Hapsburg pursues her <br id="r2l57">
            
            into her home and is safely put to bed, she joins him there for the night, <br id="r2l58">
            
            the husband having gone away tc arrange for the exile's escape, and the <br id="r2l59">
            
            three reappear at a quite incomprehensible breakfast scene, with nobody <br id="r2l60">
            
            able to tell just what, psychologically, has happened, and the curtain going <br id="r2l61">
            
            down with everything really interesting left in the alr. <br id="r2l62">
            
            Miss Fontanne and Mr. Lunt carry off their share in the proceedings as <br id="r2l63">
            
            Tonly this accomplished pair could, and you may well feel with many of the <br id="r2l64">
            
            first-night audience that this in itself is cnough. The play, as such, however, <br id="r2l65">
            
            seemed to me very disappointing. Mr. Sherwood is no Shaw, as his several <br id="r2l66">
            
            attempts at imitation have sufficiently demonstrated, nor a Viennese, either. <br id="r2l67">
            
            One wishes that he would stick to the life he knows and moods that are <br id="r2l68">
            
            native. He can be soundly entertaining here, as he proved last winter in <br id="r2l69">
