            The best essays are always autobiographical— <br id="r1l37">
            
            the creator of the essay, old Montaigne, taughe us <br id="r1l38">
            
            that—and Charles Lamb’s most delightful papers <br id="r1l39">
            
            are those in which he refers to his own experiences: <br id="r1l40">
            
            the names of dozens of them spring to our lips. But <br id="r1l41">
            
            in essay writing, as Dr. Johnson said of a man <br id="r1l42">
            
            writing an epitaph, one is not under oath: the <br id="r1l43">
            
            essayist may take a thread of truth and string <br id="r1l44">
            
            thereon a pearl—many pearls—of fiction. And <br id="r1l45">
            
            commentators are frequently misled thereby. <br id="r1l46">
            
            have been told that Lamb’s“ Oxford in Vacation'' <br id="r1l47">
            
            was written not after a visit to Oxford but after a <br id="r1l48">
            
            visit to Cambridge. The story fits onc place quite <br id="r1l49">
            
            as well as another. Lamb made love to several <br id="r1l50">
            
            shadowy maidens in his essays that may never have <br id="r1l51">
            
            lived at all, and we know—what his contem¬ <br id="r1l52">
            
            poraries did not—that he loved and proposed and was <br id="r1l53">

            face.? <br id="r1l55">
            
            And so we who love the choicest cuts of Lamb <br id="r1l56">
            
            have always taken hisBenchers'’ with a grain of <br id="r1l57">
            
            salt. Did they all live in the flesh and did Lamb <br id="r1l58">
            
            see them clear or only in his mind’s eye! These <br id="r1l59">
