            Love should not be treated as a grand passion, he says, <br id="r3l3">
            
            for it is then exciting, injurious, even deadly; love for <br id="r3l4">
            
            a roung man should be a recreation pure and simple; <br id="r3l5">
            
            above all, a liaison with a married woman should be <br id="r3l6">
            
            avoided, a sensible man permitting himself only flirta¬ <br id="r3l7">

            than he chose to give. Theodor selects his words with <br id="r3l9">
            
            direct intention, for his friend is deeply entangled in a <br id="r3l10">
            
            love affair with a married woman who loves him pas¬ <br id="r3l11">
            
            sionately—too passionately, and he is beginning to <br id="r3l12">
            
            writhe under the chains with which he has bound him¬ <br id="r3l13">
            
            self. Theodor has invited to an improvised supper his <br id="r3l14">
            
            friend“ Mizi, a vivacious young person from a mil¬ <br id="r3l15">

            rather sentimental girl of virtuous character, who has <br id="r3l17">
            
            expended the best she has to give upon Lobheimer. <br id="r3l18">
            
            The two girls presently arrive in Fritz’s rooms—Mizi <br id="r3l19">
            
            the personification of animal spirits and“cheeky“ <br id="r3l20">
            
            good-comradeship, in the gavest of costumes; Christine <br id="r3l21">
            
            shy but loving, her beauty being set off by a simple <br id="r3l22">
            
            dress. The ladies arrange the supper-table, the <br id="r3l23">
            
            men providing the eatables and wines, and soon <br id="r3l24">
            
            all is joy and convivality. After supper a <br id="r3l25">
            
            little freedom in the matter of kisses is per¬ <br id="r3l26">
            
            mitted, and Fritz sits down to play a waltz for <br id="r3l27">
            
            Mizi and her friend, Christine bending over the piano <br id="r3l28">
            
            with no eyes but for him. She tells him under cover of. <br id="r3l29">
            
            the soft music what he is to her, how his love for her <br id="r3l30">
            
            has beautified her life; and Lobheimer almost feels as <br id="r3l31">
            
            if he loves her indeed, so soothing is her gentle, tender <br id="r3l32">
            
            nature after the wild passion of the riper woman. <br id="r3l33">
            
            Suddenly the gay company are interrupted by the <br id="r3l34">
            
            ringing of the door bell; Lobheimer, looking from the. <br id="r3l35">
            
            window recognises the husband he has wronged. <br id="r3l36">
            
            Hurriedly acquainting his friends with thefact he sends <br id="r3l37">
            
            them all into another room, and admits his late visitor. <br id="r3l38">
            
            Ashort scene pregnant with meaning follows; the men <br id="r3l39">
            
            exchange but few sentences; the husband has found <br id="r3l40">
            
            Lobheimer’s letters—which he brings him¬in his wife's¬ <br id="r3l41">
            
            possession and is aware of his dishonour. He does not <br id="r3l42">
            
            wish the letters to be found“ afterwards,' he says, and <br id="r3l43">
            
            Fritz understands, and places himself at the disposal of <br id="r3l44">
            
            the man he has betrayed. The duel will take place in <br id="r3l45">
            
            two days; and the interview ends with the repression <br id="r3l46">
            
            of feeling with which it commenced. Lobheimer recalls <br id="r3l47">
            
            his friends and endeavours to act as if nothing had hap¬ <br id="r3l48">
            
            pened, but his wonted spirits will not come at his <br id="r3l49">
            
            W <br id="r3l50">
            
            bidding, and the company soon disperse. Theodor, <br id="r3l51">
            
            being requested by his friend to return, does so, and <br id="r3l52">
            
            reluctantly undertakes the office of second. <br id="r3l53">
            
            The second act shows us Christine’s home, and intro¬ <br id="r3l54">
            
            duces her father—first violin at one of thetheatres. Old <br id="r3l55">
            
            Weiring is a character in his way, and a philosopher; <br id="r3l56">
            
            he contends that the only things worth having in later <br id="r3l57">
            
            life are the “remembrances, and would rather his child <br id="r3l58">
            
            should love under any conditions than that she should <br id="r3l59">
            
            have no sweet memories in her old age. So he is later <br id="r3l60">
            
            on neither surprised nor grieved at Christine’s love for <br id="r3l61">
            
            Lobheimer, and calmly receives all the insinuations of <br id="r3l62">
            
            a mischief-making neigbbour, who tries to calumniate <br id="r3l63">
            
            his daughter. Christine herself watches all day for her <br id="r3l64">
            
            lover, who has promised to come; she is alternately <br id="r3l65">
            
            hopeful and despairing, for it is late in the evening <br id="r3l66">
            
            when he arrives. He tells her he will be absent for a <br id="r3l67">
            
            time—that he is going a journey, and in the moment of <br id="r3l68">
            
             <br id="r3l69">
            
            farewell, with a prevision of his end upon him, he really <br id="r3l70">
            
            loves the girl who has given him her life. He promises <br id="r3l71">
            
            to write to her and then, with a heavy heart, goes. <br id="r3l72">
            
            The third act contains some painfully impressive <br id="r3l73">
            
            scenes; Christine waits and watches in vain for some <br id="r3l74">
            
            token from her lover, but her father, learning the <br id="r3l75">
            
            truth, endeavours to comfort her. His words lead her <br id="r3l76">
            
            to believe Lobheimer has deserted her; and she <br id="r3l77">
            
            demands the truth from him. Theodor comes as she <br id="r3l78">
            
            is in the act of leaving for Lobheimer’s house, and <br id="r3l79">
            
            brings the news of his death. Gradually it becomes <br id="r3l80">
            
            clear to Christine that the man she loved has been <br id="r3l81">
            
            killed by the man he had betrayed; that she had never <br id="r3l82">
            
            really possessed his heart, and rhe gentle girl is in that <br id="r3l83">
            
            moment a passionate woman. She at least will go to <br id="r3l84">
            
            her dead lover to say farewell, she avows, and then <br id="r3l85">
            
            learns that he was buried that morning. His parents. <br id="r3l86">
            
            his friends, and relations were present at the funeral, <br id="r3l87">
            
            only she who had so blindly loved him had known <br id="r3l88">
            
            nothing of it, and he had left no written or spoken mes¬ <br id="r3l89">
            
            1* <br id="r3l90">
            
            sage for her. Wild with grief and the bitter conscious¬ <br id="r3l91">
            
            nessthat she was“ less than nothing' to him, she breaks <br id="r3l92">
            
            from the detaining hands of her father and rushes froto <br id="r3l93">
            
            the house. The old man does not tiy to follow her; he <br id="r3l94">
            
            is weak and powerless to help her. He sits down alone <br id="r3l95">
            
            in his despair, and cries,“ She will never return, never <br id="r3l96">
            
            again! The audience were profoundly moved, a fact <br id="r3l97">
            
            mostly due to the po##rful acting of Frau Sorma in <br id="r3l98">
