            man—were by no means blindly adopted by Broch. His third novel, <br id="r1l8">
            
            as already stated, contains a great variety of actions, of which some are <br id="r1l9">
            
            combined to form a first group, while the“ Story of the Salvation Army <br id="r1l10">
            
            girl in Berlin (that is to say, a second action) visibly goes its own way <br id="r1l11">
            
            (indicated by titles and numbered consecutively). A closer study of the <br id="r1l12">
            
            connections which must doubtless exist between the main action and this <br id="r1l13">
            
            second story reveals that the latter repeats the main action on a mystical <br id="r1l14">
            
            plane as it were, thus removing the flavour of unsavoury realism that <br id="r1l15">
            
            might otherwise cling to it. That this is indeed so is seen from the third <br id="r1l16">
            
            1 <br id="r1l17">
            
            action'’ which only takes place in the abstract, in the brain of the <br id="r1l18">
            
            author of these novels, is successively entitled“ Decay of Values, and <br id="r1l19">
            
            purports to be a philosophical interpretation of our time. <br id="r1l20">
            
            This is not too ambitious a word. It is true, of course, that the thoughts <br id="r1l21">
            
            of every really great artist issue from an individual, comprehensive <br id="r1l22">
            
            world picture, even where he only delineates figures and events, and not <br id="r1l23">
            
            philosophy: in the case of Hamsun, for example, or Gide, Conrad or <br id="r1l24">
            
            Thomas Mann, this picture could be readily abstracted from the action <br id="r1l25">
            
            and presented as a critical study. In the case of Broch this is unnecessary: <br id="r1l26">
            
            he is an author who has proved elsewhere that he is capable ofthinking out <br id="r1l27">
            
            philosophical treatise. And here also he himself transposes his symbols <br id="r1l28">
            
            on to an abstract plane: he describes a woman arranging her house, a <br id="r1l29">
            
            man arranging his life, and immediately after, in a following chapter <br id="r1l30">
            
            dealing with the style of architecture in a certain period, disengages the <br id="r1l31">
            
            event from the personal and gives it a general significance. The reader <br id="r1l32">
            
            of lighter tastes has an easy task with Broch. He can skip the philosophical <br id="r1l33">
            
            excursions without losing the thread ofthe narrative. The lover of abstrac¬ <br id="r1l34">
            
            tions on the other hana will be inclined to skip the narrative and apply <br id="r1l35">
            
            himself to the essays on“ The Decay of Valucs ?. Broch himself waits <br id="r1l36">
            
            for the third type of reader, whose thinking is wedded to life, without <br id="r1l37">
            
            being bound to reality alone. <br id="r1l38">
            
            Such a reader is richly rewarded by Broch: he learns that our world <br id="r1l39">
            
            is a world of sleep-walkers—“ over near and over far, as things are to a <br id="r1l40">
            
            child much about him (man) has become indistinct and yet <br id="r1l41">
            
            aknowledge is beginning to grow in him that he perhaps already possessed <br id="r1l42">
            
            but did not heed. And the reader learns to understand the people in <br id="r1l43">
            
            this world, the Eschs and the Huguenaus, the Pasenows and the Bertrands, <br id="r1l44">
            
            undisciplined and scruple-ridden. He sees these people in their conflict <br id="r1l45">
            
            and struggle with the conditions of everyday life, with the realities of our <br id="r1l46">
            
            time. But“ is this distorted life still reality?“. This question finds an <br id="r1l47">
            
            answer in the following: “ The unreal is the illogical. And this age <br id="r1l48">
            
            seems unable to attain a higher climax of the illogical, the antilogical: <br id="r1l49">
            
            it is as if the overwhelming reality of the war had destroyed the reality <br id="r1l50">
            
            of the world Every form is dissolved, a twilight of dull uncertainty <br id="r1l51">
