            Mr. Christopher Horne from the German of Herr <br id="r2l7">
            
            Arthur Schnitzler, is an extremely powerful littie <br id="r2l8">
            
            piay, and a remarkable oue, moreover. There 1s <br id="r2l9">
            
            practically no action: the man on whom everything <br id="r2l10">
            
            depends never moves from the chair in which, indeed, <br id="r2l11">
            
            he is dying, and yed the simple littiedrama holds the <br id="r2l12">
            
            audience irresistibly. In an extra ward of the Vienna <br id="r2l13">
            
            General Hospital Karl Rademacher's life is ebbing <br id="r2l14">
            
            away. His career has been a failure. He has worked <br id="r2l15">
            
            hard as a hack journalist to earn a scanty wage, and <br id="r2l16">
            
            what has made it all the more bitter is that, while he <br id="r2l17">
            
            has gone down bis old companion Alexander <br id="r2l18">
            
            Weihgart, no cleverer or more capable Rade¬ <br id="r2l19">
            
            macher is convinced, has steadily ascended. <br id="r2l20">
            
            His own earnest desire is to meet the man he regards <br id="r2l21">
            
            as his successful rival, to let him know that his friend¬ <br id="r2l22">
            
            ship has been a pretence, that he hates him; and he <br id="r2l23">
            
            is overjoyed when the Doctor consents to ask <br id="r2l24">
            
            Weihgart to come. There is an actor, Florian <br id="r2l25">
            
            Schubart, also in the hospital, and he suggests a <br id="r2l26">
            
            rehearsal of the coming scene; he will be Weihgart— <br id="r2l27">
            
            what has Radomacher to say to him? The writer <br id="r2l28">
            
            begins his venomous tirade, he casts the mask aside, <br id="r2l29">
            
            tells the other what he has longed to tell, and winds <br id="r2l30">
            
            up with a cruel stab—Weihgart’s wife, he <br id="r2l31">
            
            declares, has been his mistress. Erhausted by the <br id="r2l32">
            
            effort, for his wrath has carried him beyond his <br id="r2l33">
            
            strength, he is lying quietly back in his chair <br id="r2l34">
            
            when Weihgart arrives, and begins to talk <br id="r2l35">
            
            soothingly, to lament his old comrade’s misfortunes, <br id="r2l36">
            
            to speak of the disappointments and irritations that <br id="r2l37">
            
            have constantly affected himself in the midst of bis <br id="r2l38">
            
            apparent prosperity; and Rademacher is gradually <br id="r2l39">
            
            moved to gentler thoughts, his fury passes; when the <br id="r2l40">
            
            allotted quarter of an hour has gone the two part <br id="r2l41">
            
            in all kindness, Weibgart never dreaming that any <br id="r2l42">
            
            hard thought has been in his old friend’s mind. Mr. <br id="r2l43">
            
            J. D. Beveridge plays Rademacher with striking force <br id="r2l44">
            
            and finish. Complex as the dving man's fancies may <br id="r2l45">
            
            be, they are always expressed with perfect clearness. <br id="r2l46">
            
            it <br id="r2l47">
            
            The actor, who does nothing ill, has certainly not for <br id="r2l48">
            
            a long time doue anything better; it is a study which <br id="r2l49">
            
            he <br id="r2l50">
            
            will dwell in the recollection of those who see it. <br id="r2l51">

            i- lacked sincerity; bis manner, indeed, rather <br id="r2l55">
            
            ed jexpressed patronage than sympathy, and the reason <br id="r2l56">

            he <br id="r2l74">
            
            Mrs. Aurora Bumpus. Henry loves her with just the <br id="r2l75">
            
            same absorbing devotion that Eugene in Candida <br id="r2l76">
            
            feels for the clergyman’s excellent wife, and he begs <br id="r2l77">
            
            her to share his lot—simply to walk out of <br id="r2l78">
            
            the house, and take up her residence with him, <br id="r2l79">
            
            ignoring the man who“ may have loved her <br id="r2l80">
            
            as much as his sordid nature and commercial environ¬ <br id="r2l81">
            
            ment rendered possible.“ But she has something <br id="r2l82">
            
            else to think of. She is in sore trouble. He has <br id="r2l83">
            
            written her ardent verses, Aurora is the burden of <br id="r2l84">
            
            all of them, and these verses have, she is convinced, <br id="r2l85">

            fallen into the hands of a spiteful sister-in-law, who <br id="r2l87">
            
            will inevitably show them to her husband. It all <br id="r2l88">
            
            arises, she complains, from Henry having taken her <br id="r2l89">
            
            to see Candida, and she warns him that“ Teddy <br id="r2l90">

            it <br id="r2l92">
            
            play. What is to be done? Henry must say that <br id="r2l93">
            
            the poems were written to another Aurora, and <br id="r2l94">
            
            merely shown to her because of the similarity of <br id="r2l95">

            phatically denies it. The verses were written to <br id="r2l104">
            
            the goddess of dawn, his sentiments towards Mrs. <br id="r2l105">
            
            Bumpus have been merely those of calm, ordinary <br id="r2l106">
            
            triendship. Teddy does not believe. Hie has heard <br id="r2l107">
            
            thinner stories from much older men, he says; but <br id="r2l108">
            
            this will not do. Heury persists. He does not ad¬ <br id="r2l109">
            
            mire Mrs. Bumpus at all. She is no more to him <br id="r2l110">
            
            than an acquaintance—and Teddy grows furious. <br id="r2l111">
            
            Not to love bis wile is aslight to her—to her,“ the <br id="r2l112">

            attempt to strike cach other, and Aurora enters to <br id="r2l118">

            Ireland forthe lrish and Irish players for Mr. Veats’s plays, was the im¬ <br id="r4l3">
            
            pression left at the fall of the curtain on“ The Pot of Broth,“ which many <br id="r4l4">
            
            pcople liked when it was played some time ago in London. Itis disappointing <br id="r4l5">
            
            as rendered by Mr. Robert Pateman, Miss Lamborn, and Mr. Tully at the <br id="r4l6">
            
            Court. Somehow one felt that th players thought it was nonsense. Irish <br id="r4l7">
            
            people are more childlike, better at make-believe, possibly lighter of touch, <br id="r4l8">
            
            which would make all the difference to a play of this sort: a little, one-part, <br id="r4l9">
            
            rogue’s comedy. It seemed to us a pity that a poet should follow the <br id="r4l10">
            
            fashion for realism so far as to have the cries of a hen being killed outside <br id="r4l11">
            
            the cottage just before it appeared on the stage being plucked. It is not <br id="r4l12">
            
            necessarg to the playlet, and is disagreable; but perhaps this is another in¬ <br id="r4l13">
            
            justice to lreland. Very different is real realism such as one gets in In <br id="r4l14">
            
            the Hospital.“ This is a play which we would call powerful, if that word <br id="r4l15">
            
            had not deen too often used of late. It shows the sure technique ofsthe <br id="r4l16">
            
            man who is master of his materials, has known what effect he meantto <br id="r4l17">
            
            produce, and has observed and worked, however unconsciously, until hei <br id="r4l18">
            
            produced it." Inthe Hospital' is like life itself; it sets one pondering and <br id="r4l19">
            
            speculating. Leaves one wondering and interested, if sad and puzzied, for <br id="r4l20">
            
            a solution to it all. <br id="r4l21">
            
            The part of the poor, unsuccessful journalist, who resents so bitterly <br id="r4l22">
            
            the fact that he has had to use his brain to further schemes whichche <br id="r4l23">
            
            hated for scoundrels whom he despised, wäs magnificently played by Mr. <br id="r4l24">
            
            J. D. Beveridge, and it is not a part which is easy to handle. Many are <br id="r4l25">
            
            the#emotions the actor is called upon to show, most of them intense, and <br id="r4l26">
            
            all subject to the great fact that he is a dying man lying back almost <br id="r4l27">
            
            helpless in a big chair. Comparatively few are the words he has to speak, <br id="r4l28">
            
            he#never utters one to explain that he is the father of the son and daughter <br id="r4l29">
            
            his successful friend speaks of; vet author and actor between them— <br id="r4l30">
            
            the author by a third person's apparently irrelevant talk, the actor by <br id="r4l31">
            
            his actione=let the audience know this just as they would have knownn <br id="r4l32">
            
            ## theg had been present at the actual death in an actual hospital. This is <br id="r4l33">
            
            #art, great on both author’s and actors’ parts. Mr. George Trollope, as the <br id="r4l34">
            
            consumptive player, studying still even amongst the surroundings of a <br id="r4l35">
            
            hospital ward, and in spite of the fact that he has been given up bythe <br id="r4l36">
            
            doctors himself, played very tolerably. He would have been nsuch better <br id="r4l37">
            
            if he had not felt he had to get all it was worth out of an effective part. <br id="r4l38">
            
            lie was just a trifle of the theatre, theatrical. Mr. Rudge Harding, as <br id="r4l39">
            
            the successful fool friend, gave a capable character performance, which <br id="r4l40">
            
            didn't harm the play in any way, but tell short of perfection in that it was <br id="r4l41">
            
            a performance, not the presentment of the man. He never gave us one <br id="r4l42">
            
            werd or one idea that be didn't speak. The nurse’s part, though small, <br id="r4l43">
            
            was quite excellently played by Miss Isabel Grey. Indeed, it was largely <br id="r4l44">
            
            owing to her acting that the atmosphere of the hospital came out so <br id="r4l45">
            
            clearlv. Both play and players are well worth seeing. <br id="r4l46">
            
            How He Lied to Her Husband'' showed chiefly how much Mr. <br id="r4l47">
            
            Bernard Shaw has grown backwards since he wrote“ Candida.“ The <br id="r4l48">
            
            audience laughed, and expressed itself amused—Mr. Shaw’s reputation as <br id="r4l49">
            
            a witty man is world-wide—but the reception was not overpoweringly en¬ <br id="r4l50">
            
            thusiastic at the finish. Perhaps because some of us felt that we had <br id="r4l51">
            
            drained the cup of vulgarity to the dregs while we gave our best attention <br id="r4l52">
            
            to his latest work. Of course, the idea of the husband who rounds on the <br id="r4l53">
            
            lover for denvingsthat he is in love with the wife is deliciously funny, but, <br id="r4l54">
            
            chlthe difference there might have been in the leading up to this denou¬ <br id="r4l55">
            
            ment. Was it necessary to make the woman talk of verses which only a <br id="r4l56">
            
            married woman could understand? Would the boy ever have been in love <br id="r4l57">
            
            with such a woman: It is possible that another actor and actress than <br id="r4l58">
            
            Mr. Granville Barker and Miss Gertrude Kingston, “ Her Lover?' and <br id="r4l59">
            
            Herself,’ would have given an altogether different rendering of the play, <br id="r4l60">
            
            but we suppose Mr. Shaw attended the rehearsals and superintended the <br id="r4l61">
            
            stage management, and, therefore, got something near what he wanted. <br id="r4l62">
            
            If he didn't, he should have. At any rate, we can only judge of the play <br id="r4l63">
            
            as it appeared. Mr. A. G. Poulton gave an excellent performance ofthe <br id="r4l64">
            
            husband who admires his own wife so much that he wishes every man she <br id="r4l65">
            
            meets to fall in love with her. He played so convincingly that one almost <br id="r4l66">
            
            forgot to apply reason to his actions and wonder why he should have come <br id="r4l67">
            
            into the room threateningly with the compromising poems if he wished to <br id="r4l68">
            
            hear later on that they werewritten to his wise. <br id="r4l69">
