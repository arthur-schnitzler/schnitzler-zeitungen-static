            — ARTHUR SCHNITZLER <br id="r1l8">
            
             <br id="r1l9">
            
            By Paur H. GRUMMANN <br id="r1l10">
            
            IENNA, with its peculiar traditions, accepted German natural¬ <br id="r1l11">
            
            ism only with modifications. Hermann Bahr, notable as a <br id="r1l12">
            
            critic, produced a number of naturalistic dramas without, <br id="r1l13">
            
            however, making a profound impression. Indeed, Vienna <br id="r1l14">
            
            seemed to be turning away from naturalism to an artificial, <br id="r1l15">
            
            snobbish romanticism, when Arthur Schnitzler sounded a <br id="r1l16">
            
            new note in a series of dramatic dialogues published under the title of <br id="r1l17">
            
            Anatol. Schnitzler had been born in Vienna in 1862, where he devoted <br id="r1l18">
            
            himself to the study and practice of medicine, serving for a time as assistant <br id="r1l19">
            
            in the larger hospitals. Keen and philosophical by nature, the psycho¬ <br id="r1l20">
            
            logical problems presented in his practice became so interesting to him <br id="r1l21">
            
            that he turned from his profession to his old pastime of poetry for a <br id="r1l22">
            
            career. <br id="r1l23">
            
            At first sight it might seem that Schnitzler’s attitude toward his work <br id="r1l24">
            
            would be identical with Hauptmann’s. Hauptmann, however, approaches <br id="r1l25">
            
            his work in the spirit of the professional psychologist. He presents charac¬ <br id="r1l26">
            
            ters that illustrate various psychological principles. This is done so cieverly, <br id="r1l27">
            
            to be sure, that the process is not to be discerned in the finished drama. In <br id="r1l28">
            
            Schnitzler we have a keen, scientifically trained man, who turns his ability <br id="r1l29">
            
            as a diagnostician loose upon his environment, and records what he sees. <br id="r1l30">
            
            Since Vienna is his environment, and since he is interested in moral prob¬ <br id="r1l31">
            
            lems, the erotic element occupies a large place in his works. His attitude <br id="r1l32">
            
            has been termed cynical — an opinion which is scarcely correct. He is <br id="r1l33">
            
            objective in agreement with the naturalistic point of view. <br id="r1l34">
            
            A careful reading of Anatol (°92) must convince any unbiased reader <br id="r1l35">
            
            of this fact. Anatol is an introspective poet, a man of exquisite culture and <br id="r1l36">
            
            jaded nerve, who analyzes his cmotions and broods over his experiences. <br id="r1l37">
            
            He is presented in seven love adventures — at most of which Max, his <br id="r1l38">
            
            practical, half cynical friend, is present. This gives the author constant <br id="r1l39">
            
            opportunity for subtle character contrasts. As might be expected, Anatol <br id="r1l40">
            
            in his many adventures does not meet a single woman of real self <br id="r1l41">
            
            respect. Max readily estimates these women at their true worth; Anatol <br id="r1l42">
            
            takes a melancholy delight in his many disappointments. The attempt <br id="r1l43">
            
            to identify Schnitzler himself with Anatol is as absurd as the confounding <br id="r1l44">
            
            of a physician with his patient. This identification is probably due tothe <br id="r1l45">
