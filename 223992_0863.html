            Fritz Lobheimer, an oflleer in an Austrian Dragoon <br id="r1l2">
            
            Fregimnent, has been carrving on an intrigue with a <br id="r1l3">
            
            married woman, and another at the same time with <br id="r1l4">

            That is the skeleton—simple, and strong enough 10 <br id="r1l10">
            
            bear a body of genuine tragedy. Towards clothing <br id="r1l11">
            
            it with genuine tragedy tho author has gone a good <br id="r1l12">
            
            way. We learn very early in the play that Christine <br id="r1l13">
            
            #is not like her friend Mizi Schlager, a mere light¬ <br id="r1l14">
            
            o·-love, despising all men, but equally rendy to take <br id="r1l15">
            
            any lover she can get and to bid him a cheerful <br id="r1l16">
            
            good-bye when she can keep him no longer. Christine <br id="r1l17">
            
            takes theaffair very serlously. She has in her a pretty <br id="r1l18">
            
            strong dose of the will to keep. Fritz is her first <br id="r1l19">
            
            lover—for hitherto she has been quite respectable— <br id="r1l20">
            
            and he will be her last. Fritz looks at the matter <br id="r1l21">
            
            ina totally different light. Even abthe merry supper¬ <br id="r1l22">
            
            party in the first act his head is ab least as full of <br id="r1l23">
            
            the married woman as of Christine. And after that <br id="r1l24">
            
            party (Fritz is entertaining his friend Theodor Kaiser <br id="r1l25">
            
            and Theodor's“ friend Mizi, and Christine, and they <br id="r1l26">
            
            have been drinking Bruderschaff and doing all sorts <br id="r1l27">
            
            of amusing Austrian things) has been interrupted hy <br id="r1l28">
            
            the enraged husband with his challenge, he has, of <br id="r1l29">
            
            course, an additional reason for insisting to Christine <br id="r1l30">
            
            that this sort of thing is only temporary. It <br id="r1l31">
            
            is all no use. The will to keep in Christine is only <br id="r1l32">
            
            Vintensifled in the sccond act by Fritz's very charming <br id="r1l33">
            
            way of saving what he knows, but Christine docs not <br id="r1l34">
            
            know, to be probably a last farewell, vowing (what <br id="r1l35">
            
            was doubtless true atthe moment) that he really did <br id="r1l36">
            
            love her. And so it happens that in the third act, <br id="r1l37">
            
            when the news is brought to the girl that her lover is <br id="r1l38">
            
            Unot only dead, but has been shot in a duel about <br id="r1l39">
            
            Tanother woman, she is driven practically mad by her <br id="r1l40">
            
            lose. <br id="r1l41">
            
            Maduess, it has been said, is only exaggerated <br id="r1l42">
            
            selfishness. It may be so; in any case the <br id="r1l43">
            
            madness—that is, the character—of Christine is just <br id="r1l44">
            
            what, in our opinion, has prevented this play from <br id="r1l45">
            
            becoming a genuine tragedy. It has affected it in <br id="r1l46">
            
            two ways. The first, and least important, is this <br id="r1l47">
            
            Christine has been, all along, a negative person. <br id="r1l48">
            
            She appeared to have only one positive quality— <br id="r1l49">
            
            that pretty strong dose of the will to kcep. And so, <br id="r1l50">
            
            when this negative, inarticulate creature suddenly <br id="r1l51">
            
            Ubreaks into eloquence and pours out, disjointedly <br id="r1l52">
            
            but with acute point, rage and scorn and grief, we <br id="r1l53">
            
            feel that this is not Christine herself speaking, but <br id="r1l54">
            
            Tthe author. The girl herself—at any rate, as we saw <br id="r1l55">
            
            Ther yesterday—might feel these things dimly, but <br id="r1l56">
            
            she never could say them. It is the author who fecls <br id="r1l57">
            
            Uthem acutely for her, and uses her inappropriate <br id="r1l58">
            
            mouth for theexpression of them. A more important <br id="r1l59">
            
            Pmatter is this, that we sce in Christine no trace of <br id="r1l60">
            
            Tregret for the man who is dead. Nota single“ Poor <br id="r1l61">
            
            Fritz!“ passes her lips. It is herself she is thinking <br id="r1l62">
            
            Tof, the slight put upon her by the intrigue with ihe <br id="r1l63">
            
            Tother woman, the fact that Fritz on his wag to the <br id="r1l64">
            
            duel talked to Theodor of other people and things <br id="r1l65">
            
            besides herself; and these are the subject of her <br id="r1l66">
            
            Toutburst. So Christine sbrivels under our eyes. <br id="r1l67">
            
            Her sorrow is only an intensification of that <br id="r1l68">
            
            worriting to which we had scen her subject her <br id="r1l69">
            
            lover before; and tragedy is not made of women like <br id="r1l70">
            
            this. <br id="r1l71">
            
            Still, the play is a sincere, artfully-constructed, <br id="r1l72">
            
            and occasionally moving piece of work; and it js <br id="r1l73">
            
            admirably acted under the superintendence of Herr <br id="r1l74">
            
            Max Behrend. We suspect that Fritz was intended <br id="r1l75">
            
            by the author to be rather more of a“ gay dog <br id="r1l76">
            
            and rather less of a romantie hero than he was made <br id="r1l77">
            
            y Mr. Ainley; hut, granted his viewof the character, <br id="r1l78">
            
            Mr. Ainley acted it almost to perfection, Miss <br id="r1l79">
            
            Margaret Halstan, too, did well, though she failed to <br id="r1l80">
            
            find a way of reconciling the two Christines. The <br id="r1l81">
            
            part of her father, played by Mr. Hignett, was cily <br id="r1l82">
            
            saved from conventionality by the straightforward <br id="r1l83">
            
            views the old gentleman had to express on the ultimate <br id="r1l84">
            
            value of respectability in vouth, and to these Mr. <br id="r1l85">
            
            Hignett gave their full virtue. Mr. Charles Mande <br id="r1l86">
            
            and Miss Margaret Bussé romped delightfully as a <br id="r1l87">
            
            pair of light-o’-loves, and in serious moments the <br id="r1l88">
            
            former showed more than the promise off a very <br id="r1l89">
            
            capable actor. Mr. James Hearn made an intensely <br id="r1l90">
            
            vivid thing of his five minutes’ scene as the infuriated <br id="r1l91">
            
            husband, and Miss Sydney Fairbrother, as a sharp¬ <br id="r1l92">
            
            tongued neighbour, showed an art and a finish cqual <br id="r1l93">
            
            Ito Mr. Hearn's. The play will be repeaied at His <br id="r1l94">

            * Liebelei,“ produced yesterday at His Majesty’s by <br id="r4l9">
            
            che Afternoon Theatre. The story, althongh fraught <br id="r4l10">
            
            with tremendous consequences to the principal per¬ <br id="r4l11">
            
            sons concerned in it, might almost be packed in a <br id="r4l12">
            
            nutshell, so closely narrowed are its limits in <br id="r4l13">
            
            representation. A young fellow named Frits Lob¬ <br id="r4l14">
            
            heimner has fallen passionately in love with a married <br id="r4l15">
            
            woman. At the same time he is carrying on a toler¬ <br id="r4l16">
            
            ably animated flirtation with a girl called Christine. <br id="r4l17">
            
            Tho first woman we are not permitted to see, but wo <br id="r4l18">
            
            learn that ahe is of the passionate, full-blooded, and <br id="r4l19">
            
            voluptuous order. Christine, on the other hand, <br id="r4l20">
            
            Prepresents all that is sweet, gentle, and devoted in <br id="r4l21">
            
            womanhood. Presently the injured husband appears <br id="r4l22">
            
            upon the scene. He has discovered his wife’s per¬ <br id="r4l23">
            
            fidy, and nothing short of a duel to the death will <br id="r4l24">
            
            satisfy him. To the proposal Fritz, of course, is <br id="r4l25">
            
            bound to yield assent. Of the coming encounter he <br id="r4l26">
            
            tells Christine nothing however, although at the <br id="r4l27">

            thetruth that it is she whom he really loves. So Fritz <br id="r4l29">
            
            goes forth to his death, and for the last act there <br id="r4l30">
            
            remains little tthe disclosure of the catastrophe <br id="r4l31">
            
            to the broken larted Christine, whose grief is ren¬ <br id="r4l32">
            
            dered the more acute by the knowledge that there <br id="r4l33">
            
            was another woman in the case, and that Fritz had <br id="r4l34">
            
            played her false. <br id="r4l35">
            
            The little play wears a distinetly German air, while <br id="r4l36">
            
            the actions of the characters are, it must be confessed, <br id="r4l37">
            
            just a trifle kard of reconciliation with our own ideas <br id="r4l38">
            
            of the fitness of things. Consequently the work <br id="r4l39">
            
            succeeds ouly to a limited measure in arousing either <br id="r4l40">
            
            our interest or our sympathy. Fritz, the hero, is far <br id="r4l41">
            
            too neurotic and hysterical a person to make a deep <br id="r4l42">
            
            impressien upon our feelings, while Christine—fitly <br id="r4l43">
            
            deseribed by the French phrase,“ la femme col¬ <br id="r4l44">
            
            lante’—only too frequently contrives to produce <br id="r4l45">
            
            upon the audience, as upon Fritz # 'mself, rathel an <br id="r4l46">
            
            irritating impression.“ Light o’ Love,! neverthe¬ <br id="r4l47">
            
            less, contains one or two scenes of unquestionable <br id="r4l48">
            
            power; it possesses also the merit of finishing on a <br id="r4l49">
            
            high tragic note. The röle of Fritz is not altogether <br id="r4l50">
            
            a grateful one, but yesterday Mr. Henry Ainley <br id="r4l51">
            
            played it with a fervour and a convineing air of <br id="r4l52">
            
            sincerity that fairly carried the audience away. <br id="r4l53">
            
            From Miss Margaret Halstan, as Christine, was <br id="r4l54">
            
            also forthcoming an exceedingly clever performance, <br id="r4l55">
            
            the result, clearly, of much careful thought and <br id="r4l56">
            
            artistie intelligence. Technically, it would be diffi¬ <br id="r4l57">
            
            cult to improve upon it, yet in her great scene in <br id="r4l58">
            
            the flnal act there secined somehow to be missing <br id="r4l59">
            
            Just that one little touch of pure pathos which brings <br id="r4l60">
            
            the lump into the throat and the tears to the eyes <br id="r4l61">
