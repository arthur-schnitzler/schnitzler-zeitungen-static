            ARTHUR SCHNITZLER. <br id="r1l4">
            
            the fact that he was once a doctor, he is reminiscent of Mr. Henry <br id="r1l5">
            
            James—of a Mr. James, however, who writes without preciosity <br id="r1l6">
            
            about individuals linked with ordinary human beings by someshred <br id="r1l7">
            
            of normality. Among his short stories we would mention in par¬ <br id="r1l8">
            
            ticular Die Frau die Weisen, Das neue Lied, and the hypnotic <br id="r1l9">
            
            fantasia at the beginning of Dammerseelen. His latest novel, <br id="r1l10">
            
            moreover, Der Weg ins Freie, is achef d’aurre, with its delicate <br id="r1l11">
            
            and exhaustive analysis of the more modern phases of Viennese <br id="r1l12">
            
            life. His style, it should be added, flows with a limpidity and <br id="r1l13">
            
            is balanced by a cadence found only too rarely in the German <br id="r1l14">
            
            language. <br id="r1l15">
            
            To revert, however, to Schnitzler the dramatist, what are his <br id="r1l16">
            
            chief claims, his chief excellencies, his chief defects? It seems <br id="r1l17">
            
            to us that the essence of his merit lies in the fact that he handles <br id="r1l18">
            
            problems neither as ends in themselves, as do the more advanced <br id="r1l19">
            
            of our own dramatists, nor yet, like Sudermann, as mere pegs <br id="r1l20">
            
            on which to hang violently theatrical stage effects. Some <br id="r1l21">
            
            problem may constitute the centre of most of his plays; yet, <br id="r1l22">
            
            with a few exceptions, this problem is not presented too nakedly <br id="r1l23">
            
            or without sufficient relief. Each problem is bathed in an artistic <br id="r1l24">
            
            atmosphere and each character in the picture limned with the <br id="r1l25">
            
            most subtle psychology. It is true that, as has already been <br id="r1l26">
            
            pointed out, many of the acts in his longer dramas exhibit too <br id="r1l27">
            
            strong a tendeney to form self-independent pictures; yet it is <br id="r1l28">
            
            this defect which forms the chief charm of his one-acters. It <br id="r1l29">
            
            is true that nearly all his characters are Bohemian—artists, <br id="r1l30">
            
            fläneurs, actresses, journalists, doctors, painters—yet cach author <br id="r1l31">
            
            creates as of right the population of his own individual world; <br id="r1l32">
            
            and is it not rather a claim to glory to have attained such heights <br id="r1l33">
            
            of dramatie celebrity and yet scarcely ever to have written a <br id="r1l34">
            
            single play specifically devoted to fashionable life? It is true <br id="r1l35">
            
            that the ethics of these plays, with their chronic and inevitable <br id="r1l36">
            
            intrigues, may strike the English mind as somewhat unnsual; <br id="r1l37">
            
            get Schnitzler enjoys the reputation of being the most brilliant <br id="r1l38">
            
            and accurate portrayer of contemporary Viennese life. After <br id="r1l39">
            
            all, from the standpoint of dramatic art, that which counts is <br id="r1l40">
            
            not the ethics but the presentation of the problem. <br id="r1l41">
            
            Tet, with all his subtlety and all his problems, he is never <br id="r1l42">
            
            heavy. Vienna stands intellectually nearer to Paris than to <br id="r1l43">
            
            Berlin, so that the Teutonic introspection and sentimentalism <br id="r1l44">
            
            are tonched with a Gallic sprightliness and a Gallie grace. No <br id="r1l45">
            
            dramatist has written tragedy with so light a hand, or comedy <br id="r1l46">
            
            with so ironically pathetic a smile as has Arthur Schnitzler. <br id="r1l47">
