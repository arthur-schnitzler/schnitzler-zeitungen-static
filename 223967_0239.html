            human, and therefore unattractive. All along it is no <br id="r2l6">
            
            more than playing with passion. Count Arpad, a well¬ <br id="r2l7">
            
            preserved man in the mid-fifties, has had an actress <br id="r2l8">
            
            “ under his protection' since the death of his wife <br id="r2l9">
            
            twenty years earlier. When the play opens the <br id="r2l10">
            
            liaison is just ending, Lolo having decided to marry a <br id="r2l11">
            
            wealthy carriage proprietor. The Connt tekes the <br id="r2l12">
            
            matter philosophically, remembering that he has a <br id="r2l13">
            
            charming daughter, unmarried, and about the same <br id="r2l14">
            
            age as Lolo—a woman of thirty-six or so, in fact. <br id="r2l15">
            
            What he does not know is that seventeen or <br id="r2l16">
            
            eighteen years before this daughter, who is the Com¬ <br id="r2l17">
            
            tesse Mizzi, was in love with his intimate friend <br id="r2l18">
            
            Egon, Prince Ravenstein; still less does the Count <br id="r2l19">
            
            suspect that Philip, the bri, ht lad whom the Prince <br id="r2l20">
            
            introduces as his adopted sor, is in reality his daugh¬ <br id="r2l21">
            
            ter’s child, and thus his own grandson. This rather <br id="r2l22">
            
            horrible muddle, which in any primitivo or savage <br id="r2l23">
            
            community would be tragic, is here so lighily treated <br id="r2l24">
            
            —for Vienna is lighter far than Paris—as to become <br id="r2l25">
            
            almost comic. Even the meeting between mother and <br id="r2l26">
            
            son, which ought to be full of poignancy, has no real <br id="r2l27">
            
            significance, just because there is no blood, no heart <br id="r2l28">
            
            in it all. And the introduction of the two womein <br id="r2l29">
            
            seemed full of possibilities; yet they came to nothing. <br id="r2l30">

            —as in truth she had, the Prince being by ne means <br id="r2l32">

            * Thank goodness for that!? There is now a bond <br id="r2l35">
            
            between them. We leave these queer people—that is <br id="r2l36">
            
            to say, the Count and his daughter and the Prince <br id="r2l37">
            
            and his son—about to set out for Ostend, and there <br id="r2l38">
            
            are nct wanting signs that Comtesse Mizzi may soon <br id="r2l39">

            touches of the true Schnitzler cynicism, is altogether <br id="r2l51">

            to give a hit of tho life of Paris at the <br id="r2l54">
            
            start of the Revolution, somewhat d /a Carlyle, or, <br id="r2l55">
            
            perhaps, more nearly d la Dickens. The date <br id="r2l56">
            
            is July 14, 1789—the day on which the Bastille <br id="r2l57">
            
            was stormed—and the scene is“ The Green Cockatoo, <br id="r2l58">
            
            an underground tavern kept by one Prosper, formerly <br id="r2l59">
            
            a theatre manager, who, remembering his old calling, <br id="r2l60">
            
            has turned his cellar into a place of entertainment as <br id="r2l61">
            
            well as of refreshment. The entertainment is of the <br id="r2l62">
            
            Grand Guignol?’ variety, horrors being the chief <br id="r2l63">
            
            attraction. Thus one of the“ company '’—say, the <br id="r2l64">
            
            tragic, intense Henri—will arrive during ehe evening, <br id="r2l65">
            
            and, when silence is secured relate with tremendons <br id="r2l66">
            
            energy and every appearance of reality how he has <br id="r2l67">
            
            strangled an aristocrat, his wife’s lover. It matters <br id="r2l68">
            
            nothing that the story be false: what the fashionable <br id="r2l69">
            
            folk frequenting the haunt require is a tbrill. So <br id="r2l70">
            
            when the elegant ladies and gentlei#en—the Vicomte <br id="r2l71">
            
            de This, the Marquis and Marquue de That, the <br id="r2l72">
            
            Chevalier de So-and-So—hear Henri narrate his killing <br id="r2l73">
            
            of the Duc de Cadignan they applaud the actor’s skill, <br id="r2l74">
            
            never thinking there can be any truth in what he has <br id="r2l75">
            
            said. Nor is there at the moment; but ihen the Duc <br id="r2l76">
            
            appears a little later the justly jealous husband, <br id="r2l77">
            
            Henri, rushes at him and stabs him to the heart. As <br id="r2l78">
            
            in Pagliacci,' the play has turned inte grim reality. <br id="r2l79">
            
            Then the mob surges in triumphant. The Bastille is <br id="r2l80">
            
            taken and already in flames. The aristocrats make <br id="r2l81">
            
            their way out as best they can, while someone remarks <br id="r2l82">
            
            there is no need to detain them now, as their turn will <br id="r2l83">
            
            come shortly, and they can be found when wanted. It <br id="r2l84">
            
            is a strong and decidedly picturesque piece, wich <br id="r2l85">
