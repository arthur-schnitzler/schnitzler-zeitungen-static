            This is more of a drama than a comedy, and we think such <br id="r1l18">
            
            a description to be a misnomer. The subject handled by Arthur <br id="r1l19">
            
            Schnitzler (whose“ Beatrice and Other Tales“ made such a wide <br id="r1l20">
            
            appeal, and whose skilful dissection of the human mind when <br id="r1l21">
            
            suffering from strong sexual and other emotions will be remem¬ <br id="r1l22">
            
            bered) is a delicate oue. <br id="r1l23">
            
            Professor Bernhardi has under his care in the hospital a <br id="r1l24">
            
            young girl, who thinks she is getting better, and is completely <br id="r1l25">
            
            happv. The Professor knows she is doomed. He decides that <br id="r1l26">
            
            rather than let her realise her death is inevitable, as she would <br id="r1l27">
            
            if the priest came to visit her, he will forbid the priest admis <br id="r1l28">
            
            sion, and let her die in peace. His action causes deep feeling <br id="r1l29">
            
            amongst his colleagues, and the subject is fiercely discussed, and <br id="r1l30">
            
            sides taken. It is obvions that such a controversy is pregnant <br id="r1l31">
            
            with possibilities, possibilities which are not lost when Arthur <br id="r1l32">
            
            Schnitzler is the stage-manager. The verdict goes against Bern¬ <br id="r1l33">
            
            hardi, but the priest admits to him privately, that, as à doctor, he <br id="r1l34">
            
            acted absolutely correctly, and also was not actnated by Jewish ani¬ <br id="r1l35">
            
            mosity towards the Catholie Church. <br id="r1l36">
            
            As the publishers state,“a remarkable piece of work, but <br id="r1l37">
            
            we wish Arthur Schnitzler had written a beok on this subject <br id="r1l38">
            
            rather than this little playwhich however, grips, and has some <br id="r1l39">

            With the exception of a character¬ <br id="r3l5">
            
            reading given in February this year <br id="r3l6">
            
            at the Little Theatre by the Jewish <br id="r3l7">
            
            Drama League, this play has not yet <br id="r3l8">
            
            been acted in England, though it was <br id="r3l9">
            
            first produced in Berlin in 1912 and <br id="r3l10">
            
            has been played in most ofthe larger <br id="r3l11">
            
            towns of Germany and Austria. <br id="r3l12">
            
            The scene is laid in Vienna in the <br id="r3l13">
            
            year 1900, and the highly original <br id="r3l14">
            
            plot hinges on the action of Dr. <br id="r3l15">
            
            Bernhardi, the director of a hospital, <br id="r3l16">
            
            who refuses on one occasion to <br id="r3l17">
            
            allow a priest to give the Last Sac¬ <br id="r3l18">
            
            raments to a dying girl. It is made <br id="r3l19">
            
            quite clear to the reader that the <br id="r3l20">
            
            motive for this refusal is not medical <br id="r3l21">
            
            caution, not religious prejudice—Dr.“ <br id="r3l22">
            
            Bernhardi is a Jew—but a kind of <br id="r3l23">
            
            Humanitarianism. <br id="r3l24">
            
            The patient is certain to die in a <br id="r3l25">
            
            very short time, but she feels quite <br id="r3l26">
            
            well and happy, without the slightest <br id="r3l27">
            
            idea that death is imminent. The <br id="r3l28">
            
            doctor, imagining that the priest’s <br id="r3l29">
            
            visit will spoilthis happiness, refuses <br id="r3l30">
            
            him admission to the ward. There <br id="r3l31">
            
            is a discussion, in the course of <br id="r3l32">
            
            which the doctor places his hand on <br id="r3l33">
            
            the priest’s shoulder to detain him. <br id="r3l34">
            
            Almost at once another doctor an¬ <br id="r3l35">
            
            nounces that all is over—and the <br id="r3l36">
            
            priest at once departs! <br id="r3l37">
            
            The remainder of the play deals <br id="r3l38">
            
            with the intrigues and machmations <br id="r3l39">
            
            of the Director’s enemies and rivals, <br id="r3l40">
            
            who, to gain their own private ends, <br id="r3l41">
            
            use this incident to bring about his <br id="r3l42">
            
            downfall. Anti-Semitism, political <br id="r3l43">
            
            intrigue, personal spite, ignorant <br id="r3l44">
            
            popular indignation, and a badly con¬ <br id="r3l45">
            
            ducted trial cause the Director to <br id="r3l46">
            
            be imprisoned for“ Sacrilege, and, <br id="r3l47">
            
            incidentally, obscure the real issue <br id="r3l48">
            
            of the plav. <br id="r3l49">
            
            It must be admitted that the char¬ <br id="r3l50">
            
            acter of Bernhardi is well-drawn, and <br id="r3l51">
            
            admirable, that the dialogue is clever <br id="r3l52">
            
            and convincing, that interest is well¬ <br id="r3l53">
            
            maintained: but nothing can redeem <br id="r3l54">
            
            the enormous technical howler which <br id="r3l55">
            
            allows the priest to depart without <br id="r3l56">
            
            giving at least conditional Absolu¬ <br id="r3l57">
            
            tion. And there are not wanting <br id="r3l58">
            
            little touches in the dialogue which <br id="r3l59">
            
            will offend Catholic ears; little signs <br id="r3l60">
            
            that a mild form of Jewish propa¬ <br id="r3l61">
            
            ganda is being smuggled into the <br id="r3l62">
            
            plav. <br id="r3l63">
            
            The publisher’s “ puff“ on the <br id="r3l64">
            
            dust wrapper puts the problem thus: <br id="r3l65">
            
            whether it is better to die in peace <br id="r3l66">
            
            (in the ordinary sense) or at peace <br id="r3l67">
            
            (in the theological).* That, how¬ <br id="r3l68">
            
            ever, is so far from being the prob¬ <br id="r3l69">
            
            lem of the play that it is not a proh¬ <br id="r3l70">
            
            lem at all, once you understand its <br id="r3l71">
            
            terms. <br id="r3l72">
            
            The translation (by Hetty Land¬ <br id="r3l73">
            
            stone) is, so far as we can judge, ad¬ <br id="r3l74">
            
            mirable. <br id="r3l75">
            
            One wonders, in conclusion, why <br id="r3l76">
            
            the Jewish Drama League alone <br id="r3l77">
