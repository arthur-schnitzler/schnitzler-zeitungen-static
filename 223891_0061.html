            his carlier Anatol.“ It is difficult to portray the love affairs <br id="r1l12">
            
            uofafatold man of 60—even if he has the reputation of Casa¬ <br id="r1l13">
            
            nova or even of Don Juan himself for that marter, as anything more than <br id="r1l14">
            
            rather sickening. Snitzler, however, has attempted and succeeded in that <br id="r1l15">
            
            difficult task and the result is a combination of real wit and infinite charm. <br id="r1l16">
            
            Snitzler has taken as the theme of his story a part of the life of Casanova <br id="r1l17">
            
            that have failed to obtain notice in his voluminous memoirs—his return to <br id="r1l18">
            
            Venice, the town of his birth, to die after many years of weary exile. <br id="r1l19">
            
            While awaiting the decree at Padua he happens by chance on an old <br id="r1l20">
            
            friend who insists on taking him to his home. Casanova though old is still <br id="r1l21">
            
            irresistible to the ladies and the wife of his friend is most anxious to resume <br id="r1l22">
            
            the place in Casanova’s fleeting affections that she once occupied. He has <br id="r1l23">
            
            gazed uvon the lovely face of her young niece however and has sworn that <br id="r1l24">
            
            she shall be his. The young lady is disdainful of him and for once in his <br id="r1l25">
            
            life he begins to realize that old age is upon him. He refuses however to <br id="r1l26">
            
            give her up and by a clever subteringe manages to obtain his end. It leaves <br id="r1l27">
            
            him with a sorry realization of himself and he creeps into Venice almost <br id="r1l28">
