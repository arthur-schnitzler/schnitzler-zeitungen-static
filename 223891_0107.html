            The movement toward lower prices <br id="r3l9">
            
            in books is settling enough so that <br id="r3l10">

            we have noticed the type of novel <br id="r3l22">
            
            that cost 82.50 now priced at 82. <br id="r3l23">

            rather than by its size. For years <br id="r3l39">
            
            we have been buying with every book <br id="r3l40">
            
            —and a book for one’s library is an <br id="r3l41">
            
            asset—something else that was a <br id="r3l42">
            
            debit—so much bulk on which we <br id="r3l43">

            French edition was a featherweight <br id="r3l51">
            
            affair that would go in a man's <br id="r3l52">
            
            pocket. The American translation <br id="r3l53">
            
            was not only bound in cloth, but <br id="r3l54">
            
            bulked out to make an ordinary-sized <br id="r3l55">
            
            novel. And yet the French version <br id="r3l56">
