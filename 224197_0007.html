            living, — he who has inwardly prided himself that he has fathomed this <br id="r1l6">
            
            woman at every step. <br id="r1l7">
            
            The third play takes place on the night of the storming of the Bastille. <br id="r1l8">
            
            Prospere, the director of a theater, has hit upon the unique plan of operating <br id="r1l9">
            
            something like a theater in a tavern. He buys the Green Cockatoo <br id="r1l10">
            
            Tavern,' retains his actors and has them relate all kinds of supposed ex¬ <br id="r1l11">
            
            periences in the guise of truth. The fact that some of their stories are half <br id="r1l12">
            
            true throws a peculiar illusion of reality over the performance. The pro¬ <br id="r1l13">
            
            fligate aristocracy of Paris find that this type of entertainment produces the <br id="r1l14">
            
            desired creeps. They flock to the tavern and mingle with the players. <br id="r1l15">
            
            Thus it turns out that at these gatherings many play the part of criminals <br id="r1l16">
            
            without being criminals, others recite their crimes without being taken seri¬ <br id="r1l17">
            
            ously — some believe themselves to be criminals without proper justification <br id="r1l18">
            
            — others again are criminals without becoming conscious of the fact. The <br id="r1l19">
            
            illusions of these men and women are so hopelessly tangled that their life <br id="r1l20">
            
            resolves itself into a Chinese puzzle. The most serious criticism that was <br id="r1l21">
            
            leveled at this play was that the author allowed his cleverness to tempt <br id="r1l22">
            
            him into a plot that is so complex that it resembles trickery rather than <br id="r1l23">
            
            art. It can not be denied, however, that he succeeded in producing the <br id="r1l24">
            
            illusion that he desired to create. <br id="r1l25">
            
            Bologna in the days of Casar Borgia furnished the background for an <br id="r1l26">
            
            historical drama, The Veil of Beatrice' (°00). Nardi, an old engraver of <br id="r1l27">
            
            Bologna has lost his reason because his wife has become untrue to him. <br id="r1l28">
            
            Her lapses threaten to demoralize the whole family. The oldest child, <br id="r1l29">
            
            Rosena, is completely corrupted. Francesco, the son, enters military <br id="r1l30">
            
            service because he is disgusted with his home. He determines, moreover, <br id="r1l31">
            
            to protect his sister Beatrice, a beautiful girl of sixteen, from the dangers <br id="r1l32">
            
            that threaten her. The poet Loschi has sung many love songs to Teresina, <br id="r1l33">
            
            the sister of Count Andrea Fantuzzi. At a time when he is crazed by her <br id="r1l34">
            
            coldness, he meets Beatrice, and falls in love with her. Bologna is in <br id="r1l35">
            
            danger of falling into the hands of Borgia, and Loschi decides to flee from <br id="r1l36">
            
            the city with Beatrice. When all is in readiness, she relates her strange <br id="r1l37">
            
            dream of the previous night. She has dreamed that Duke Lionardo <br id="r1l38">
            
            Bentivoglio, the master of Bologna, had made her his bride, and that all <br id="r1l39">
            
            of Bologna, including Loschi, had bowed before her throne. Loschi looks <br id="r1l40">
            
            upon this dream as evidence of spiritual infidelity, breaks with Beatrice, <br id="r1l41">
            
            and sends her home. Her brother, Francesco, ignorant of all this, fears, <br id="r1l42">
            
            nevertheless, for the future of his sister and determines to marry her to an <br id="r1l43">
            
            unassuming young craftsman, the apprentice of his father. Beatrice <br id="r1l44">
            
            consents, but just as they depart for the priest Lionardo intercepts them. <br id="r1l45">
            
            Lionardo expects defeat on the next day and has resolved to spend his last <br id="r1l46">
