            her father, but she undergoes nameless torments. Not only the guilt <br id="r1l7">
            
            but her rescue from its natural consequences is a source of continual re¬ <br id="r1l8">
            
            morse. Schnitzler finally reassures her that what she has experienced and <br id="r1l9">
            
            what has lured her has not been life —the highest significance of her <br id="r1l10">
            
            existence. He adds: Who knows but later — far later — from a day of <br id="r1l11">
            
            disaster like the present one, the call of life will ring into your life far deeper <br id="r1l12">
            
            and purer than on that onc on which you have experienced things that bear <br id="r1l13">
            
            such terrible names as murder and death.' The complexity of the plot of <br id="r1l14">
            
            this drama and the nature of the action might suggest the melodramatic, <br id="r1l15">
            
            if the author had not ennobled the play throughout by characterizations <br id="r1l16">
            
            of the utmost keenness. <br id="r1l17">
            
            The burlesque spirit of the Punch and Judy playe pervades the three <br id="r1l18">
            
            one-act dramas published as Puppet Plays’ (’06). In the first, The <br id="r1l19">
            
            Puppet Player,' George Merklin, induces Anna to pretend that she is in <br id="r1l20">
            
            love with Eduard Jagisch, a timid oboe player. Anna enters into this <br id="r1l21">
            
            plot in order to arouse the jealousy of George, whom she loves. Years <br id="r1l22">
            
            pass, and George becomes a self-satisfied speculative vagabond. Eduard <br id="r1l23">
            
            meets him by chance and takes him to his home, where George learns that <br id="r1l24">
            
            the old puppet play has had serious consequences. Eduard is married to <br id="r1l25">
            
            Anna, and is the happy fatherof a son. <br id="r1l26">
            
            The characters of the sccond play, Brave Cassian,' are of a coarse <br id="r1l27">
            
            type. Martin believes that he has found à certain way of winning at dice. <br id="r1l28">
            
            He is so conceited about his success that he resolves to go into the world <br id="r1l29">
            
            and win for himself one of the stars of the demi-monde. His old mistress, <br id="r1l30">
            
            Sophie, comes to take her farewell, and the two are interrupted by Cassian, <br id="r1l31">
            
            Martin’s cousin, who immediately takes an interest in Sophie. Cassian <br id="r1l32">
            
            hears Martin's account of his mysterious cleverness at dice. The two play <br id="r1l33">
            
            and Cassian loses all of his money. When Cassian fully realizes the superb <br id="r1l34">
            
            qualities of Sophie, he makes unmistakable advances to her, at which Martin <br id="r1l35">
            
            becomes angry, in spite of the fact that he is about to desert her. The <br id="r1l36">
            
            ensuing quarrel leads to a rcopening of the game, with the result that <br id="r1l37">
            
            Martin loses all — his money, his clothes, his mistress, and finally his life. <br id="r1l38">
            
            The technique of The Green Cockatoo' reappears in The Great <br id="r1l39">
            
            Puppet Show.' It is a play within a play. The director, poet, and audi¬ <br id="r1l40">

            bers of the audience begin to comment, and these comments are blended <br id="r1l42">
