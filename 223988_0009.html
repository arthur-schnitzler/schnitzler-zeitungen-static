            sions of sympathy generally! Several of my colleagues in¬ <br id="r1l62">

            OLGA:—Quite the customary thing, I should say. <br id="r1l70">
            
            ROB:—Oh, no! <br id="r1l71">
            
            ROB:—To be sure! But I keep asking myself whether <br id="r1l72">

            at bottom my bereavement, taken all in all, is really deserv¬ <br id="r1l74">
            
            that Eveline knew, even though it be at the risk of forfeiting <br id="r1l75">
            
            ing of this widespread sympathy—or expression of sympathy. <br id="r1l76">
            
            your esteem. But thus, by chance, I wouldn't like to have <br id="r1l77">
            
            OLGA (Quite shocked) :—How can you think that? <br id="r1l78">
            
            you discover them. <br id="r1l79">
            
            ROB:—Because I suffer so little. I only know that she is <br id="r1l80">
            
            ROB:—I assure vou you will always command my esteem. <br id="r1l81">
            
            n0 more. I am conscious of the bare fact with feelings so <br id="r1l82">
            
            OLGA:—Who knows? You know you have always over¬ <br id="r1l83">
            
            shockingly unequivocal that it tortures me to think of it; dut <br id="r1l84">

            within all is icy and transparent as the air on winter dawns. <br id="r1l86">
            
            ROB:—I cannot bring myself to believe that these letters <br id="r1l87">
            
            OLGA:—This feeling cannot last. The awakening pang <br id="r1l88">
            
            contain something unknown to me. (Pause.) What’s more, <br id="r1l89">
            
            will come—and that will be better for you in the end. <br id="r1l90">
            
            it isn't your own secrets you wish to preserve. <br id="r1l91">

            OLGA:—What makcs you think so? Eveline had no <br id="r1l97">
            
            long ago? <br id="r1l98">
            
            secrets which you did not share. <br id="r1l99">
            
            ROB:—The giving of herself—ourselves—to one another. <br id="r1l100">
            
            ROB:-I'm not inquisitive. You may take your letters. <br id="r1l101">

            OLGA (With less confidence) :—How useless? <br id="r1l118">
            
            and I would not be surprised to see him here—today yet. <br id="r1l119">

            If when be arrives at Vienna he loses no time—— <br id="r1l121">
