            youth falls in love with Anna, a young Jewess, whose family is on the down¬ <br id="r1l7">
            
            ward course. <br id="r1l8">
            
            This acquaintance is more serious, and Anna in time looks forward <br id="r1l9">
            
            to motherhood. His association with Anna, brings George into close touch <br id="r1l10">
            
            with various types of Jews in Vienna. These are characterized with an <br id="r1l11">
            
            uncompromising irony. George feels that Anna does not share their <br id="r1l12">
            
            characteristics, yet he is disturbed by her loyalty to the members of her <br id="r1l13">
            
            race. More and more he realizes that he is in the enemy's country, <br id="r1l14">
            
            and consequently he feels relieved when his child dies at birth. The <br id="r1l15">
            
            definite prospect of a position as the conductor of an orchestra awakens <br id="r1l16">
            
            the more serious side of his nature and he breaks with Anna in order to <br id="r1l17">
            
            find his way into the open.' It would be rash to pronounce this book <br id="r1l18">
            
            an unqualified success. The two problems presented clash. <br id="r1l19">
            
            The awakening of a young dilettante to the serious problems of life <br id="r1l20">
            
            has not been faultlessly blended with the tragedy of the young Jewess, who <br id="r1l21">
            
            yearns to rise above the sordidness of her race — yet cannot break the ties <br id="r1l22">
            
            that bind her to it. She cannot return to George without a proposal of <br id="r1l23">
            
            marriage, and he cannot make this proposal because he feels the barrier <br id="r1l24">
            
            and is lured on by the possibilities of a carcer which presumably might be <br id="r1l25">
            
            hampered by family obligations. A clear-cut solution of this entanglement <br id="r1l26">
            
            is hardly possible. Relentless irony is visited upon the Jews for their sup¬ <br id="r1l27">
            
            posed cold and selfish intellectualism, their lack of real intellectual and <br id="r1l28">
            
            emotional depth; but the dallying emotionalism of this pampered baron, <br id="r1l29">
            
            who will accomplish little even if he finds his way into the open' is taken <br id="r1l30">
            
            in a most philosophical spirit. The fact that George is in love with Anna <br id="r1l31">
            
            would, by no means, make it necessary for him to associate exclusively with <br id="r1l32">
            
            Jews. Although their brilliancy attracts him, he always feels disappointe“ <br id="r1l33">
            
            when he sums up any single experience with them. In the face of this <br id="r1l34">
            
            fact, it is simply exasperating to follow George from Jewto Jewas if he had <br id="r1l35">
            
            no choice whatsoever in the shaping of his environment. <br id="r1l36">

            morals of the ancient aristocracy. Count Arpad, at the death of his wife, <br id="r1l39">
            
            takes a mistress, Lolo, with whom he lives undisturbed for eighteen years. <br id="r1l40">
            
            Although there is not the slightest attempt at real secrecy, he punctiliously <br id="r1l41">
            
            avoids insulting the conventions of his corrupt class. During the first year <br id="r1l42">
            
            he is so interested in Lolo that he does not realize that his daughter Mizzi <br id="r1l43">
            
            is being betrayed by his friend, Prince Egon. Mizzi leaves home for a <br id="r1l44">
