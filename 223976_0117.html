            MARG.—Your writing a novel and my writing a novel are <br id="r1l35">
            
            GIL.—At that time you pictured it so; or, at all events, that <br id="r1l36">
            
            two different things. <br id="r1l37">

            GIL.—Maybe. <br id="r1l39">

            hours devoted to artistic labor. And your future doesn't de¬ <br id="r1l43">

            pend on the throw. <br id="r1l45">
            
            were canny, shamefully canny, perversely canny. And it suited <br id="r1l46">
            
            GIL.—And you? <br id="r1l47">

            MARG.—That’s what I’ve done. Only a half hour ago <br id="r1l49">
            
            you. Vou were at all times a snob. And, by Jovel you've at¬ <br id="r1l50">
            
            Clement left me because I confessed to him that I had writ. <br id="r1l51">
            
            tained vour end. You have decoyed your blue-blooded boy <br id="r1l52">
            
            a novel. <br id="r1l53">
            
            with his well-manicured hands and his unmanicured brain, <br id="r1l54">
            
            GIL.—Left you—for good? <br id="r1l55">
            
            your matchless horseman, fencer, marksman, tennis player, <br id="r1l56">
            
            MARG.—I don't know. But it isn't unlikely. He went <br id="r1l57">
            
            heart-trifier—Marlitt could not have invented him more re¬ <br id="r1l58">
            
            away in a fit of anger. What he'll decide to do I can't pre¬ <br id="r1l59">
            
            volting than he actually was. Yes, what more can you wish? <br id="r1l60">
            
            dict. <br id="r1l61">
            
            Whether he will satisfy you—you are acqu, inted with some¬ <br id="r1l62">
            
            GIL.—So he objects to your writing, does he? He can't <br id="r1l63">
            
            tlung nobler—is, of course, another question, I can only say <br id="r1l64">
            
            bear to see his mistress put her intelligence to some use. <br id="r1l65">
            
            that, in my view, you are degenerate in love. <br id="r1l66">
            
            Capital! And he represents the blood of the country! H'm! <br id="r1l67">
            
            MARG.—That must have struck you on the train. <br id="r1l68">
            
            And you, vou’re not ashamed to give yourself up to the arms <br id="r1l69">
            
            GIL.—Not at all. It struck me this very moment. <br id="r1l70">
            
            of an idiot of this sort, whom you once— <br id="r1l71">
            
            MARG.—Make a note of it then; it’s an apt phrase. <br id="r1l72">
            
            MARG.—Don't you speak of him like that. You don't <br id="r1l73">
            
            GIL.—I’ve another quite as apt. Formerly you were a <br id="r1l74">
            
            know him. <br id="r1l75">
            
            woman; now you're a “sweet thing.“ Ves, that’s it. What <br id="r1l76">
            
            GIL—Ahl <br id="r1l77">
            
            attracted you to a man of that type? Passion—frank and <br id="r1l78">
            
            MARG.—You don't know why he objects to my writing. <br id="r1l79">
            
            filthy passion— <br id="r1l80">
            
            Purely out of love. He feels that if I go on I will be living <br id="r1l81">
            
            MARG.—Stop! You have a motive— <br id="r1l82">
            
            in a world entirely apart from him. He blushes at the thought <br id="r1l83">
            
            GIL.—My dear, I still lay claim to the possession of a <br id="r1l84">
            
            that I should make copy of the most sacred feelings of my <br id="r1l85">
            
            soul. <br id="r1l86">
            
            soul for unknown people to read. It is his wish that I belong <br id="r1l87">
            
            MARG.—Except now and then. <br id="r1l88">
            
            to him only, and that is why he dashed out—no, not dashed <br id="r1l89">
            
            GIL.—Please don't try to disparage our former relations. <br id="r1l90">
            
            out—for Clement doesn't belong to the class that dashes out. <br id="r1l91">
            
            It’s no use. They are the noblest experiences you've ever <br id="r1l92">
            
            GIL.—Your observation is well taken. In any case, he went <br id="r1l93">
            
            had. <br id="r1l94">
            
            away. We will not undertake to discuss the tempo of his <br id="r1l95">
            
            MARG.—Heavens, when I think that I endured this twad¬ <br id="r1l96">
            
            going forth. And he went away because he could not bear <br id="r1l97">
            
            dle for one whole year 1— <br id="r1l98">
            
            to see you surrender yourself to the creative impulse. <br id="r1l99">
            
            GIL.—Endure? You were intoxicated with joy. Don't try <br id="r1l100">
            
            MARG.—Ah, if he could only understand that! But, of <br id="r1l101">
            
            to be ungrateful. I'm not. Admitting that you behaved never <br id="r1l102">
            
            course, that can never be. I could be the best, the faithfulest. <br id="r1l103">
            
            so execrably at the end, yet I can't bring myself to look upon <br id="r1l104">
            
            the noblest woman in the world if the right man only existed. <br id="r1l105">
            
            it with bitterness. It had to come just that way. <br id="r1l106">
            
            GIL.—At all events, you admit he is not the right man. <br id="r1l107">
            
            MARG.—Indeed! <br id="r1l108">
            
            MARG.—I never said that! <br id="r1l109">
            
            GIL.—I owe you an explanation. This: at the moment <br id="r1l110">
            
            GIL.—But you ought to realize that he’s fettering you, un¬ <br id="r1l111">
            
            when you were beginning to drift away from me, when home¬ <br id="r1l112">
            
            doing you utterly, seeking through egotism, to destroy your <br id="r1l113">
            
            sickness for the stables gripped you—la nostalgie de bécurie— <br id="r1l114">
            
            inalienable self. Look back for a moment at the Margaret you <br id="r1l115">
            
            at that very moment I was inwardly done with you. <br id="r1l116">
            
            were; at the freedom that was yours while you loved me. <br id="r1l117">
            
            MARG.—Impossible. <br id="r1l118">
            
            Think of the younger set who gathered about me and who <br id="r1l119">
            
            GIL.—Vou failed to notice the least sign in your character¬ <br id="r1l120">
            
            belonged no whit less to you? Do you never long for those <br id="r1l121">
            
            istic way. I was done with you. To be plain, I didn't need <br id="r1l122">
            
            days? Do vou never call to mind the small room with its <br id="r1l123">
            
            you any longer. What you had to give you gave me. Your <br id="r1l124">
            
            balcony—. Beneath us plunged the Isar—. (He seises her <br id="r1l125">
            
            uses were fulfilled. In the depths of your soul you knew, un¬ <br id="r1l126">
            
            hand and presses her near.) <br id="r1l127">
            
            consciously von knew— <br id="r1l128">
            
            MARG.—Ah! <br id="r1l129">
            
            MARG.—Please don't get so hot. <br id="r1l130">
            
            GIL.—All’s not beyond recall. It need not be the Isar, <br id="r1l131">
