            Next to Der Biberpelz,' Arthur Schnitzler’s <br id="r1l7">
            
            three-act drama Liebelei“’ is indubitably the <br id="r1l8">
            
            most interesting piece of work the German actors <br id="r1l9">
            
            have yet presented. It is a characteristically and <br id="r1l10">
            
            intimately Viennese play, depicting a phase of <br id="r1l11">
            
            life peculiar to the Austrian capital. The title <br id="r1l12">
            
            Liebelei may be (very inadequately) translated <br id="r1l13">
            
            Dalliance, and the morlg ofthe leading person¬ <br id="r1l14">
            
            ages are certainly not above reproach; yet their <br id="r1l15">
            
            irregular relations have not the grossness and vul¬ <br id="r1l16">
            
            garity of what is commonly called“ fast'' life, but <br id="r1l17">
            
            are founded upon a certain measure, at any rate, <br id="r1l18">
            
            of real affection and kindness. In a word, the <br id="r1l19">
            
            grisette of midl-century Paris seems to survive <br id="r1l20">
            
            (though not without a difference) in the Kaiserstadt, <br id="r1l21">
            
            and Liebelei“ is a study of the Teutonic <br id="r1l22">
            
            grisette. <br id="r1l23">
            
            We are introduced in the first act to a gay little <br id="r1l24">
            
            supper at the rooms of Fritz Lobheimer. The <br id="r1l25">
            
            party consists of Fritz and his friend Theodor with <br id="r1l26">
            
            their sweethearts Christine Weiring and Mizzi <br id="r1l27">
            
            Schlager. It is evident from the first that the <br id="r1l28">
            
            characters of the two girls are very dfferent. Chris¬ <br id="r1l29">
            
            tine is sentimental, passionate, essentially pure¬ <br id="r1l30">
            
            minded, and deeply devoted to Fritz, her first and <br id="r1l31">
            
            only love. Mizzi is a good-hearted, frivolous little <br id="r1l32">
            
            creature, sincerely attached to Theodor, but <br id="r1l33">
            
            neither expecting nor very scriously desiring that <br id="r1l34">
            
            their relation should endure for wer. Sho shocks <br id="r1l35">

            whereas for Christine there is only one man in <br id="r1l37">
            
            the world. We soon learn that Fritz is oppressed <br id="r1l38">
            
            by a load of anzietv. He has formed (before he <br id="r1l39">
            
            knew Curistine) a liaison with a married woman, ane <br id="r1l40">
            
            he is sure that her husband has now discovered it. <br id="r1l41">
            
            In the middle of the supper party there comes a <br id="r1l42">
            
            peremptory knock at the door. The two girls <br id="r1l43">
            
            are hurried into another room, and the visitor <br id="r1l44">
            
            is admitted. It is the injured husband, who has <br id="r1l45">
            
            come to challenge Fritz. The duel is arranged <br id="r1l46">
            
            for the morrow, the girls are recalled, and the <br id="r1l47">
            
            supper party proceeds with such gaiety as the <br id="r1l48">
            
            voung men can müster un. The two remaining <br id="r1l49">
            
            acts take place in Christine’s home. In the <br id="r1l50">
            
            second act she confesses her love to her father, <br id="r1l51">
            
            an old musician, and has a scene of parting with <br id="r1l52">
            
            Fritz who visits her for the first time in her <br id="r1l53">
            
            home. and tells her that he is leaving Vienna for <br id="r1l54">
            
            a few days. Something in his manner fills her <br id="r1l55">
            
            with a vague fear, and the scene is all the more <br id="r1l56">
            
            poignant as we know that Fritz is üirmly convinced <br id="r1l57">
            
            that he is going to his death. His presentiment <br id="r1l58">
            
            is fulfilled, and in the last act Theodor comes to <br id="r1l59">
            
            break the news to Christine. She is not only <br id="r1l60">
            
            heartbroken, but tortured by the discovery that <br id="r1l61">
            
            she was a mere ineident in the life of her lover, <br id="r1l62">
            
            who fought and died for another woman. In the <br id="r1l63">
            
            end she rushes away from her home maddened <br id="r1l64">
            
            by grief, and her old father falls on his kuees <br id="r1l65">
            
            sobbing:“ I shall never see her again.' This <br id="r1l66">
            
            littie every-day tragedy is full of life, truth, cha¬ <br id="r1l67">
