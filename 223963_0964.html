            a holy inspiration—and that a higher grade <br id="r1l5">
            
            of truth might be injured than that which you <br id="r1l6">
            
            believe to have protected now. <br id="r1l7">
            
            Priest: There exists nothing higher for me, <br id="r1l8">
            
            than my church, and the law of my church, <br id="r1l9">
            
            which is obedience, by reason of which infinite <br id="r1l10">
            
            blessing is radiated over the whole world, and <br id="r1l11">
            
            without which, the whole sphere of usefulness <br id="r1l12">
            
            might be lost. <br id="r1l13">
            
            Bernhardi: It scems to me, Your Rever¬ <br id="r1l14">
            
            ence, that priests have existed, who only found <br id="r1l15">
            
            their true sphere of activity, when they ex¬ <br id="r1l16">
            
            cluded themselves from the community, and <br id="r1l17">
            
            spread that which they considered truth and <br id="r1l18">
            
            Justice, regardless of trouble and danger. <br id="r1l19">

            Bernhardi: Well—? <br id="r1l21">
            
            Priest: Then God would have made me <br id="r1l22">
            
            tell before the court today, what you alone <br id="r1l23">
            
            are now hearing within these four walls. <br id="r1l24">
            
            Bernhardi: Then it was God who sealed your <br id="r1l25">
            
            Ips in court today, and now it is the same God <br id="r1l26">
            
            who sends you to me, to tell me, eye to eye, <br id="r1l27">
            
            what he prevented you from saying in court. <br id="r1l28">
            
            1 must say that he makes it easy for yeu, your <br id="r1l29">
            
            God. <br id="r1l30">

            Well, 1 <br id="r1l36">
            
            do not consider this as proof that you are in <br id="r1l37">
            
            and that T am on the outside There is nothing <br id="r1l38">

            gou took the trouble of coming here in vain. <br id="r2l3">
            
            For I cannot absolve you as completely as <br id="r2l4">
            
            you may have expected, after such an ex¬ <br id="r2l5">
            
            traordinary step. <br id="r2l6">
            
            Priest: Absolution! That is not what 1 <br id="r2l7">
            
            wanted from you. I think that I have made <br id="r2l8">
            
            a mistake; I see it now. The true reason you <br id="r2l9">
            
            denied me admission to that death-bed, was not <br id="r2l10">
            
            your sense of duty or responsibility—that was <br id="r2l11">
            
            only a pretext. The real reason lies much <br id="r2l12">
            
            deeper—it is—how shall I put it—an antipa¬ <br id="r2l13">
            
            thy—an uncontrollable antipathy—nay, it is <br id="r2l14">
            
            hostility—. <br id="r2l15">
            
            Bernhardi: You speak of hostility. Does <br id="r2l16">
            
            not all that has happened to me justify the <br id="r2l17">
            
            feeling you call hostility? Yes, I cannot deny <br id="r2l18">
            
            that in the last weeks, I may have felt antip¬ <br id="r2l19">
            
            athy, not against vou personally, but against <br id="r2l20">
            
            the crowd that surrounds you. But I can as¬ <br id="r2l21">
            
            sure you in perfect truth, that when I refused <br id="r2l22">
            
            vou admittance at the door, there was not a <br id="r2l23">
            
            shadow of hostile feeling in my soul. I stood <br id="r2l24">
            
            before you there in my capacity as a physi¬ <br id="r2l25">
            
            cian, with as clear a conscience as that of any¬ <br id="r2l26">
            
            one of your vocation performing his holy rite <br id="r2l27">
            
            at the altar; not less clear than yours when you <br id="r2l28">
            
            entered the room now. You confessed it to <br id="r2l29">
            
            me. You cannot suddenly change your opinion, <br id="r2l30">
            
            because you feel the same as I do, and per¬ <br id="r2l31">
            
            haps never felt it stronger than at this hour, <br id="r2l32">
            
            that a certain something separates us which <br id="r2l33">
            
            even under the most favorable circumstances, <br id="r2l34">
            
            we cannot deny. <br id="r2l35">
            
            Priest: And you never felt this stronger <br id="r2l36">
            
            than at this moment? <br id="r2l37">
