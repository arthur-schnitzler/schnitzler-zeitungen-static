            Koltunov was disagrecable and miserable, and was conscious <br id="r1l22">
            
            looking round every now and again as if he feared that some¬ <br id="r1l23">

            find it. I’lI come round for it by and by.? <br id="r1l32">
            
            Koltunov saw it and asked provocatively: <br id="r1l33">
            
            He gave a little laugh, but said nothing. <br id="r1l34">
            
            * Wouldn't you like something to read? No doubt von <br id="r1l35">
            
            About midnight Yudin said to me,“ Do go round and see <br id="r1l36">
            
            would. But I shan't let you have the book.? <br id="r1l37">
            
            if you can get the book. By now he must, surely, be fast <br id="r1l38">
            
            Yudin was exasperated. Turning pale, he exclaimed, <br id="r1l39">
            
            asleep.? <br id="r1l40">

            dimly in the depths of space. In front of me, as if wanting to <br id="r1l50">
            
            The whole incident finished quite simply. One morning <br id="r1l51">
            
            show me the way, a frog was leaping. In the distance whistled <br id="r1l52">
            
            when Koltunov came on duty he flung the book to Yudin and <br id="r1l53">
            
            a train. From the pump-room came the soft singing of the <br id="r1l54">
            
            called out: <br id="r1l55">

            Yudin’s nose was immediately inside the covers of the <br id="r1l59">
            
            Vellow light streamed from Koltunov’s window. It lit up <br id="r1l60">
            
            book. In the evening we read it together. The book told <br id="r1l61">
            
            a pile of sleepers, the trunk of the poplar and the ground <br id="r1l62">
            
            the story of a good woman who got married to a ne’er-do-well <br id="r1l63">
            
            below it. Through the muslin curtains that stretched across <br id="r1l64">
            
            sort of a man—a husband with whom she could not live, from <br id="r1l65">
            
            the window I beheld Koltunov. He was sitting, attired for <br id="r1l66">
            
            whom she separated and went to spend herself in the service <br id="r1l67">

            of mankind. <br id="r1l69">
            
            and his fingers buried in his red hair. His sharp chin moved <br id="r1l70">
            
            Was this, then, the reason why Koltunov shed tears, I <br id="r1l71">
            
            convulsively. Tears were dropping from his eyes upon the <br id="r1l72">

            volume between his elbows. One after another they kept <br id="r1l74">
            
            Suddenly Koltunov came staggering into ihe room. <br id="r1l75">
            
            falling. It seemed to me as if I heard the soft moist tapping <br id="r1l76">
            
            Catching hold of the door-posts he yelled: <br id="r1l77">
            
            of the tears on the pages of the book. <br id="r1l78">
            
            * D-don't ... d-dare .. to r-read !? <br id="r1l79">
            
            Oh, it is a bitter experience to sec a man shed tears! <br id="r1l80">
            
            He was shockingly drunk. His bleary eyes glared wildly. <br id="r1l81">
            
            On#h#labie stood a lamp; a bottle of vodka, not touched; <br id="r1l82">

            insignificant still. He held up the book over the lamp, trying <br id="r1l94">
            
            And there in the doorway, behind Koltunov stood the little <br id="r1l95">
            
            to dry his tears on it. He touched the pages to sec if they <br id="r1l96">

            upward like a flame—she stood and in a dull voice asked: <br id="r1l101">
