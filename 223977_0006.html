            Mr. J. D. Beveridge, whose performance of the <br id="r1l53">
            
            dying Rademacher was worthy of the highest <br id="r1l54">
            
            praise. The man has been a failure, mainly, one <br id="r1l55">
            
            feels, through his own fault, and nowon his death¬ <br id="r1l56">

            that of gratifying, and for the last time, his spite <br id="r1l59">
            
            and revenge. Töthat end he begs the doctor to <br id="r1l60">
            
            bring him his old friend Weihgart, an eminent <br id="r1l61">
            
            and successful poet. Years ago they quarrelled <br id="r1l62">
            
            and parted, and now Rademacher’s one wish is to <br id="r1l63">
            
            humiliate him by telling him to his face that he <br id="r1l64">
            
            has been his wife’s lover, that heandshe have often <br id="r1l65">
            
            discussed him disparagingly together, and that <br id="r1l66">
            
            Weihgart's wife is as fully convinced of bis <br id="r1l67">
            
            complete nullity as his old friend Rademacher. <br id="r1l68">
            
            The scene is acted before us in a sort of dress <br id="r1l69">
            
            rehearsal of it with Schubart, a young actor dying <br id="r1l70">
            
            also in the hospital of consumption; yet when <br id="r1l71">
            
            Weihgart comes something touches Rademacher, <br id="r1l72">
            
            and he feels he can no longer do it. What that <br id="r1l73">
            
            something is is conveyed to us with extreme <br id="r1l74">
            
            delicacy and subtlety by Mr. Beveridge. It is <br id="r1l75">
            
            not exactly pity for Weihgart andthe confessionhe <br id="r1l76">
            
            makes of the insecurity of his position owing to the <br id="r1l77">
            
            persistency with which the new generation are <br id="r1l78">
            
            knockingathis door. Ibis, one feels, a combination of <br id="r1l79">
            
            elements, and chief among them the recollection <br id="r1l80">
            
            of the day when they were friends, and the desire <br id="r1l81">
            
            of dying with some purer feeling in his heart than <br id="r1l82">
            
            that of gratified revenge. So Weihgart goes, with <br id="r1l83">
            
            his belief in his wife intact, and Rademacher dies, <br id="r1l84">
            
            a better man than probably he ever lived. Acted <br id="r1l85">
            
            asit was, by Mr. George Trollope as Schubart and <br id="r1l86">
            
            by Mr. Rudge Harding as Weihgart, “ In the <br id="r1l87">

            in the case of bounty-fed sugar, and he considers the <br id="r2l1">
            
            results tobe admirable. We may conclude that, if he got <br id="r2l2">
            
            the mandate he desires at the coming election, he would <br id="r2l3">
            
            proceed next to practisc on steel-billets which are sup¬ <br id="r2l4">
            
            posed to be sold below cost price here because they <br id="r2l5">
            
            are tariff-protected abroad. The Providence which watches <br id="r2l6">
            
            over Free Trade has happily, in the interval, enabled us to <br id="r2l7">
            
            gauge the probable results from practical experience. <br id="r2l8">
            
            We are not the least surprised that in these circum¬ <br id="r2l9">
            
            stances Mr. Bazrouk’s party should be very restive about <br id="r2l10">
            
            the Fiscal question or that Mr. Bauroun himself should be <br id="r2l11">
            
            endeavouring by all possible means to change the issue. <br id="r2l12">
            
            Nevertheless, the letter in which he tells the Unionist <br id="r2l13">
            
            candidate for Buteshire that the issue at the next election <br id="r2l14">
            
            will be—not Fiscal Reform, but—Home Rule is really <br id="r2l15">
            
            atrifle too audacious. The MacDonnell incident is not <br id="r2l16">
            
            yet a weck old, and the public do not forget that <br id="r2l17">
            
            the suspected Home Ruler is still Permanent Under¬ <br id="r2l18">
            
            Secretary for lreland, and that the Ministers who have <br id="r2l19">
            
            flirted with “projects of Home Rule,' as Mr. Batrouk <br id="r2l20">
            
            himself called them, are still members of the Govern¬ <br id="r2l21">
            
            ment. It is not for us to say whether Mr. Bazrouk is <br id="r2l22">
            
            wise or otherwise in thus condoning this incident, but, if <br id="r2l23">
            
            he decides to do so, his efforts to beat up prejudice against <br id="r2l24">
            
            his opponents on the Irish question will simply exeife <br id="r2l25">
            
            laughter. But this, like everything else, is perfectly well <br id="r2l26">
            
            understood by his own partv as another piece of his <br id="r2l27">

            nuch more than it concerns the Liberal Party, and we <br id="r2l34">
            
            are not surprised to learn that these final proceedings <br id="r2l35">
            
            have angered the Chamberlainites without allaying the <br id="r2l36">
            
            suspicions ofthe Free Traders. Mr. Baxroun will probably <br id="r2l37">
            
            make a bolt back into the Chamberlain camp next week, <br id="r2l38">
            
            but surely it is time for the Unionist Party to take the. <br id="r2l39">

            A TRIPLE BILL AT THE COURT THEATRE. <br id="r2l42">
            
            It is one of the mysteries of Theatre-land that the great success <br id="r2l43">
            
            of the original“ triple bill'' of modern times produced a very <br id="r2l44">
            
            small crop of imitations. Speaking as a person of experience in <br id="r2l45">
            
            theatrical matters, 1 shouid say that no entertainment would have <br id="r2l46">
            
            so great a chance of success in the present troubled times as a <br id="r2l47">
            
            triple bill. The new programme of the Scart Theatre consists <br id="r2l48">
            
            of three interesting pieces, nonc, I tear, quite of sufficient import¬ <br id="r2l49">
            
            ance to produce any very great success. Certainly we spent a <br id="r2l50">
            
            very agreeable afternoon —agreeable with mixed pleasures. The <br id="r2l51">
            
            affair began with Mr. Veats’s play“ A Pot of Broth,“’ given not <br id="r2l52">
            
            long agb at the Royalty Theatre. It is entirely anecdotal, and <br id="r2l53">
            
            very diverting on a first hearing; by way of reminder, one may <br id="r2l54">
            
            mention that it tells of a trick played by a hungry tramp upon <br id="r2l55">
            
            the uncharitable wite of a small farmer. Mr. Robert Pateman, <br id="r2l56">
            
            a versatile actor of great ability, too rarely seen of late in London, <br id="r2l57">
            
            gave an admirable humorous performance as the tramp, and if it <br id="r2l58">
            
            must be hinted that he acted a little too much to the audience tliere <br id="r2l59">
            
            is a fair excuse in the fact that he had to begin with a long <br id="r2l60">
            
            soliloquy.“ In a Hospital, by Arthur Schnitzler, translated by <br id="r2l61">
            
            Christopher Horne—item No. 2—is a curious, rather audacious <br id="r2l62">
            
            experiment in play-making. It is difficult exactly to point out in <br id="r2l63">
            
            what it is novel; perhaps, indecd, its only novelty lies in the fact <br id="r2l64">
            
            that the author has attempted to give subtleties and fine shades <br id="r2l65">
            
            beyond the range of drama. As the title suggests, the play passes <br id="r2l66">
            
            in the ward of a hospital. The central figure is Rademacher, an <br id="r2l67">
            
            elderly journalist, dying of something with an unmentioned Latin <br id="r2l68">

            betwcen him and Florian Schubart, a consumptive actor, wio, <br id="r2l70">
            
            though within eight days of death, has the typical optimism of <br id="r2l71">
            
            the consumptive and is making eager plans for the future. <br id="r2l72">
            
            Rademacher is sitting in a chair facing the audience throughout <br id="r2l73">
            
            the play, and to me perhaps the chief interest in the matter lay <br id="r2l74">
            
            in the cxtraordinary play of light and shadow upon the rugged <br id="r2l75">
