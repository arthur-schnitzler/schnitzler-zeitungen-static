            has been in its time a novel, a play, and a silent <br id="r4l33">
            
            film. It was inevitable a talking film should be <br id="r4l34">
            
            made of it, and to be expected that the direction <br id="r4l35">
            
            would be in the hands of Mr. Basil Dean. His <br id="r4l36">
            
            treatment belongs to the theatre more than 10 <br id="r4l37">

            technique, but so long as he is contented to be <br id="r4l43">
            
            straightforward and unselfconscious, so long is <br id="r4l44">

            free from distertion and vulgarity, has allowed <br id="r4l49">

            woman, her acting gains immensely in authority, <br id="r4l65">
            
            and when poor Tessa dies in that shabby bed¬ <br id="r4l66">
            
            room in Brussels, every aspect of her lovable, <br id="r4l67">
            
            tempestuous nature has been made known to us. <br id="r4l68">

            Baxter and Mr. Athole Stewart, are thoroughly <br id="r4l75">
            
            happy in their interpretations of their parts, and <br id="r4l76">
            
            Miss Leonora Corbett makes an intelligent effort <br id="r4l77">
            
            to show how jealousy and an unadmitted sense <br id="r4l78">
            
            of inferiority can turn a pleasant, normal woman <br id="r4l79">
            
            like Florence into something evil and vindictive. <br id="r4l80">
            
            It is a pity, though, that the scene in which <br id="r4l81">
            
            Florence finds Lewis’s father has a title is <br id="r4l82">
            
            omitted, for it illuminates one side of her <br id="r4l83">
            
            character perfectly. Some of the scenes in the <br id="r4l84">

            deserved, but nevertheless the result of a tragic <br id="r4l99">
            
            failing. It is perhaps because it observes this <br id="r4l100">
            
            classical rule that the film, though it lacks any <br id="r4l101">
