            lacking in inspirational qualities. This play is <br id="r1l13">
            
            deliberately controversial and like all plays of <br id="r1l14">
            
            that type its merits are rather hidden by its <br id="r1l15">
            
            propaganda. The theme is the Jewish doctor <br id="r1l16">
            
            who by denwing a Catholic priest access to a <br id="r1l17">

            with a force that would have been irresistible <br id="r1l22">
            
            had the author been able to understand the real <br id="r1l23">
            
            arguments for the opposite side. Like all propa¬ <br id="r1l24">

            of clumsiness about it. It scems to be a good story <br id="r1l36">
            
            that has gone wrong, but, perhaps, not so far <br id="r1l37">
            
            wrong as many another good story. There areg <br id="r1l38">

            Embassy Theatre from whence it has been <br id="r2l12">
            
            transferred to the Phoenix, It is a grim <br id="r2l13">
            
            drama by an author whio is better known as <br id="r2l14">
            
            a cynical writer of comedy than as one <br id="r2l15">
            
            cccupied with the deeper sources of human <br id="r2l16">
            
            sentiment. The story, in a nutshell, is con¬ <br id="r2l17">
            
            cerned with the scientist’s refusal to allow a <br id="r2l18">
            
            Ipriest to give extreme unction to a dying <br id="r2l19">
            
            girl, on tlie plea that it would make her last <br id="r2l20">
            
            sminutes on earth unhappy if she were told <br id="r2l21">
            
            Ithat she was about to die. The question, <br id="r2l22">
            
            What is happiness?“ arises and the inter¬ <br id="r2l23">
            
            esting point is that it is shown under <br id="r2l24">
            
            different aspects as seen by the characters. <br id="r2l25">
            
            Meanwhile the girl dies. <br id="r2l26">
            
            This event occurs in the first scene of the <br id="r2l27">
            
            first Act, but the consequences are shown <br id="r2l28">
            
            throughout the play. Professor Bernhardi is <br id="r2l29">
            
            made to suffer for obstructing the priest, he <br id="r2l30">
            
            loses his post as head of the Elizabeth Insti¬ <br id="r2l31">
            
            tute and is finally imprisoned for two <br id="r2l32">
            
            months. He comes out as determined as <br id="r2l33">
            
            ever that what he did was right and was <br id="r2l34">
            
            his duty. The priest, well acted by Mr. <br id="r2l35">
            
            Bernard Merefield, in a scene towards the <br id="r2l36">
            
            close of the play begins by expressing his <br id="r2l37">
            
            regret that the professor, who, after all, acted <br id="r2l38">
            
            according to his conscience, should have <br id="r2l39">
            
            suffered because of his complaint, but re¬ <br id="r2l40">
            
            tracts his admission when he thinks that the <br id="r2l41">
            
            Jew acted really because he hated everything <br id="r2l42">
            
            that the priest stood for. But they shake <br id="r2l43">
            
            hands and part as honourable focs. The chief <br id="r2l44">
            
            motive of the play is worked out amid a <br id="r2l45">
            
            tangle of intrigue among the doctors and pro¬ <br id="r2l46">
            
            fessors, most of whom are out to advance <br id="r2l47">
            
            their own interests at the expense of <br id="r2l48">
            
            Bernhardi. The Jew professor is the most <br id="r2l49">
            
            interesting character in the piece, and he <br id="r2l50">
            
            comes to life very convincingly in the hands <br id="r2l51">
            
            of Mr. Abraham Sofaer. Mr. Earle Gray is <br id="r2l52">
            
            excellent as his supplanter and Mr. Ronald <br id="r2l53">
            
            Adam, who was part translator and also pro¬ <br id="r2l54">
            
            ducer of the play, scored as Dr. Flint, as <br id="r2l55">
            
            did Mr. Garside as Professor Cyprian. <br id="r2l56">
            
            The play, which was well acted, is one of <br id="r2l57">
            
            those“ conversation pieces“ which have <br id="r2l58">
