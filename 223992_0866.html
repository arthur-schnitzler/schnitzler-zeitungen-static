            It has usually been leftto France and Germany to show us the <br id="r2l4">
            
            Poetry and the stragedy of the relations leading not to marriage <br id="r2l5">

            Generalisations are dangerous, but there comes to mind no <br id="r2l7">

            Schnitzler’s“ Libelei, the value of which in an English transia¬ <br id="r2l11">
            
            tion was discovered yesterday afternoon. When the subject <br id="r2l12">
            
            attnacts the attention of dhe British or Manx dramatist, only <br id="r2l13">

            —b be said on the question from the British point of view. We <br id="r2l16">
            
            Ekopt ühe safe and steady rule that if a thing is too shocking for <br id="r2l17">
            
            A play, turn it into a melodrama or a musical comedy. <br id="r2l18">
            
            But shere fhis rule does not run, wonderful are the pictures <br id="r2l19">
            
            which may be drawn of this side of life by the man who has eyes <br id="r2l20">
            
            to see andsthe gift of drawing. Brieux saw and drew the tragedy <br id="r2l21">
            
            of ühe man and the woman unable to part, and was cynical; <br id="r2l22">
            
            Schnitzler saw the tragedy of the parting and mourned; and the# <br id="r2l23">
            
            moralist may pick crumbs of comfort from the reflection that it is <br id="r2l24">
            
            tragedy both ways. But Schnitzler does not state the problem in <br id="r2l25">
            
            its most acute form. In countries where wild oats are a com¬ <br id="r2l26">
            
            paratively respectable vegetable, the girl who has given herself <br id="r2l27">
            
            body and soul finds sooner or later that the man must marry in <br id="r2l28">
            
            his own set; and if her soul is really given, she probably ends, if <br id="r2l29">
            
            French, in the Seine, and if German in the—no, not in the Spree; <br id="r2l30">
            
            if Genman she will adopt some method other than drowning. Thät <br id="r2l31">
            
            is thie tragedy with the sensc of thie inevitable; but it is less in¬ <br id="r2l32">
            
            evitable that the man, really loving her all the time, should be <br id="r2l33">
            
            shot bv the husband of another woman, whom he also really loves. <br id="r2l34">
            
            That tlie voung man is in this position is a curious and remarkable <br id="r2l35">
            
            kind of accident, making him rather worthy to be kicked; and <br id="r2l36">
            
            this is the only noticeable weakness in an otherwise fine and, at <br id="r2l37">
            
            times, strikingly beautiful play. <br id="r2l38">
            
            Nor does this weakness in anv way touch Christine, the central <br id="r2l39">
            
            figurc of the story. She is the daughter of a simple old nuisician, <br id="r2l40">
            
            and Fritz is her first and only love. She is no inhabitant of thef <br id="r2l41">
            
            half-world, but of that world where there is no immorality, hut <br id="r2l42">
            
            only absolute trust; a distinstion which may secm subtle to inter¬ <br id="r2l43">
            
            fering neighbours like Frau Biäder, but is obvious at once as soon <br id="r2l44">
            
            as you see Christine. She revels at Fritz’s supper with Theodor <br id="r2l45">
            
            and Mizi, who take dife lightly, and to wihom wild oats are wild g <br id="r2l46">
            
            oats and motlung more; but her revelling is ladylike and touched <br id="r2l47">
            
            with sadness, for Eritz, theugh professig love, is worried, and <br id="r2l48">
            
            has a secret which he makes very clumsy efforts to conccal. The# <br id="r2l49">
            
            secret is that the husband has paid a short call, and tlie duel is to <br id="r2l50">
            
            take place to-morrow. He gives hints about love being not ## <br id="r2l51">
            
            eternal, which frighten her; and parts from her with an air of <br id="r2l52">
            
            distraction which leaves her full of foreboding. Mizi maddens her <br id="r2l53">
            
            by speaking of men as Mizi knows them, and of loves which pass <br id="r2l54">
            
            and are forgotten. Frau Binder hints unpleasant things, and can¬ <br id="r2l55">
            
            not be expected to understand. Finally she confesses all to her <br id="r2l56">
            
            father. Then she finds that Fritz is dead. He was shot in a duel, <br id="r2l57">
            
            sighting for another woman. She will go to him. But she can't, <br id="r2l58">
            
            for he is buried; they buried him that morning. She will go to <br id="r2l59">
            
            his grave. But the othel woman, they remind her awkwardly, <br id="r2l60">
            
            may be praying there. She is not going to pray; and in a burst <br id="r2l61">
            
            of passion, half bitterness, half uncontrollable grief, she rushes <br id="r2l62">
            
            out to an end we do not know, but an end which can only be death. <br id="r2l63">
            
            The old father knows; and he says she will never come back. <br id="r2l64">
            
            And so is the moralist justified; but in his triumph will pay a <br id="r2l65">
            
            tribute to a scene of wonderful beauty and power. Clearly <br id="r2l66">
            
            very much depended upon the actress. A chance like this. had <br id="r2l67">
            
            never yet come to Miss Margaret Halstan, at any rate in any play <br id="r2l68">
            
            in which she had appeared in London; and she rose to the occa¬ <br id="r2l69">
            
            sion magnificently. Sincerity and intelligence she had always <br id="r2l70">
            
            shown; but this was a revelation of a new capacity for che perfect <br id="r2l71">
            
            expression of the keenest emotion which was beyond anything <br id="r2l72">
            
            which she has hitherto given reason to expect. It was a really fine <br id="r2l73">
            
            performance, and will go far towards establishing her in the very <br id="r2l74">
            
            front rank. But the whole of the acting would have done credit <br id="r2l75">
