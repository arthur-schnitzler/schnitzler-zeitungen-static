            not be numbered among his best <br id="r1l35">

            clerk in the ministry of education. <br id="r1l39">
            
            feels himself going mad. He accuses <br id="r1l40">
            
            himself of the death of his wife, a <br id="r1l41">
            
            frail, elinging creature who died of <br id="r1l42">

            brother, physician. In the end he <br id="r1l47">
            
            actually does kill his brother. This <br id="r1l48">
            
            conclusion, though a bit violent, is <br id="r1l49">
            
            determined by a curious metaphys¬ <br id="r1l50">
            
            ical concept; namely, that premo¬ <br id="r1l51">
            
            ritions have the power to fulfill <br id="r1l52">
            
            themselves; that thought sequences <br id="r1l53">
            
            are endless and flower in the world <br id="r1l54">
            
            of physical events; and, finally, that <br id="r1l55">
            
            death does not exist since every <br id="r1l56">
            
            limit to a chain of thought must <br id="r1l57">
            
            have yet another limit, and so on ad <br id="r1l58">
            
            infinitum. <br id="r1l59">
            
            Flight into Darkness“ is written <br id="r1l60">
            
            with all of Schnitzler’s skill and <br id="r1l61">
            
            inimitable charm. If the vehement <br id="r1l62">
            
            ending shocks us, it is because we <br id="r1l63">
            
            feel its incongruity with the gentle <br id="r1l64">
            
            autumnal narrative niood that leads <br id="r1l65">
            
            to it. Evidently Schnitzler <br id="r1l66">
            
            up <br id="r1l67">
            
            sensed that his small novel would <br id="r1l68">
            
            have no reason for being if the <br id="r1l69">
            
            metaphysical framework were not <br id="r1l70">
            
            present. So he put it there, a little <br id="r1l71">
            
            forcibly; but it enabled him mean¬ <br id="r1l72">
            
            while to dally; as in his other <br id="r1l73">
            
            novels and plays, with the trio of <br id="r1l74">
            
            fate, death and love, and their awe¬ <br id="r1l75">
            
            inspiring closeness in the normal <br id="r1l76">
            
            current of our lives. In the author’s <br id="r1l77">
            
            own life these forces blended, as 1 <br id="r1l78">
            
            had occasion to observe when I last <br id="r1l79">
            
            saw Arthur Schnitzler some years <br id="r1l80">
            
            age: He brooded deeply on his <br id="r1l81">
            
            separation from his wise. He <br id="r1l82">
            
            mourned the loss of a beloved <br id="r1l83">
            
            daughter who had just taken her <br id="r1l84">
            
            own life in Italy. And as he gazed <br id="r1l85">
            
            at a small porcelain statue of <br id="r1l86">

            itself— with only a tithe done of <br id="r1l90">
            
            what he felt clamoring for expres¬ <br id="r1l91">

            When his life is scen at last in <br id="r1l93">
