            Although the theme of the book is admittedly the quite universal literary <br id="r2l2">
            
            theme of men and women, the author here deals with it in a cold and analytical, <br id="r2l3">
            
            one might even say scientißie, manner that precludes any salacious interpretation. <br id="r2l4">
            
            A careful scrutiny ofthe text reveals not a single line, not a single word, that <br id="r2l5">
            
            might be regarded as obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent, or disgusting <br id="r2l6">
            
            within the meaning ofthe statute.5 <br id="r2l7">
            
            On December 9, 1920, however, Philip Pesky, who had also been ar¬ <br id="r2l8">
            
            rested on the complaint of Mr. Sumner, was convicted in the Court of <br id="r2l9">
            
            Special Sessions by Justices Frederic Kernochan, William A. Walling, <br id="r2l10">
            
            and Max Solomon, who held that the book was “obscene and indecent, <br id="r2l11">
            
            being a lurid story of ten incidents of illicit love relations. '55 On Janu¬ <br id="r2l12">
            
            ary 17, 1930, ihe defandant was arraigned for judgment and the court <br id="r2l13">
            
            suspended sentence. On June 23, 1930, this conviction was affirmed by <br id="r2l14">
            
            the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Vork with twoofthe <br id="r2l15">
            
            five judges dissenting. <br id="r2l16">
            
            Reigen is in a way the counterpart of Anatol. Whereas Anatol’s love <br id="r2l17">
            
            affairs are treated in a light and playful mood, portrayed with a certain <br id="r2l18">
            
            benign tolerance of his foibles, and surrounded with a kind of romantic <br id="r2l19">
            
            halo, the Reigen scenes are a ruthless unmasking of the animal instincts <br id="r2l20">
            
            in man, which often parade under the guise of friendship and love. The¬ <br id="r2l21">
            
            former work, considerably overrated, has spread Schnitzler’s fame <br id="r2l22">
            
            throughout the civilized world. Reigen, on every count superior to Anatol, <br id="r2l23">
            
            both as a work of art and in its unerring observation and its almost un¬ <br id="r2l24">
            
            canny dissection of human motives, has become one of the most notori¬ <br id="r2l25">
            
            ous and maligned works in a generation. Although it was written solely <br id="r2l26">
            
            in obedience to the inner urge of a creative artist who felt impelled to <br id="r2l27">
            
            cometo a reckoning, harsh and cruel though it be, with the philandering <br id="r2l28">
            
            promiscuity he saw everywhere about him, Schnitzler nevertheless <br id="r2l29">
            
            realized full well that because of the powerful sexual and social taboos <br id="r2l30">
            
            of the time publication could produce only a gross misinterpretation of <br id="r2l31">
            
            his intentions. Three years elapsed after the composition of these scenes <br id="r2l32">
            
            before he even ventured to have a small manuscript edition printed for <br id="r2l33">
            
            his friends, and another three years before it became available to the <br id="r2l34">
            
            public in book form. The latter event caused consternation even among <br id="r2l35">
            
            many of his friends. To be sure, such outstanding men as Felix Salten, <br id="r2l36">
            
            Hermann Bahr, and M. G. Conrad rallied to his defence, but the great <br id="r2l37">
            
            majority of reviewers denounced the work in no uncertain terms. In <br id="r2l38">
            
            Austria the book itself was never molested, but in Germany it was al¬ <br id="r2l39">
            
            most at once forbidden and confiscated. <br id="r2l40">
            
            Despite repeated requests Schnitzler firmly and consistently refused <br id="r2l41">
            
            his authorization for public production until 1920. The few isolated <br id="r2l42">
            
            attempts to stage these scenes were made against his wishes or even <br id="r2l43">
            
            without his knowledge. Only after Max Reinhardt assured the author <br id="r2l44">
            
            that he would devote all his energies to the creation of an unobjection¬ <br id="r2l45">
            
            able and highly artistic production did Schnitzler reluctantly yield to <br id="r2l46">
            
            his persuasion. We have attempted to trace the subsequent history of <br id="r2l47">
            
            Reigen on the stage and the dire consequences that followed in its wake, <br id="r2l48">
            
            especially in the cities of Berlin, Vienna, and Munich. <br id="r2l49">
            
            To the impartial observer these violent attacks upon Reigen havea <br id="r2l50">
            
            very sinister aspect. Rarely, if ever, was objection raised to the work for <br id="r2l51">
            
            alleged artistic shortcomings, the only sound criterion to apply to a work <br id="r2l52">
            
            of art. Rarely did the agitation proceed from genuine moral indignation <br id="r2l53">
            
            or disinterested motives. Morally sensitive peopie do not as a rule de¬ <br id="r2l54">
            
            liberately seek out opportunities to be shocked, nor do they resort to <br id="r2l55">
            
            mob violence. Furthermore, some of the worst offenders had neither <br id="r2l56">
            
            seen the book or read the play. From the tone and temper of the journal¬ <br id="r2l57">
            
            istic onslaughts as well as from the very nature of the theatre scandals <br id="r2l58">
            
            and riots, it is obvious that the vast majority of protestants were ani¬ <br id="r2l59">
            
            mated by political motives based on religious, nationalistic, or anti¬ <br id="r2l60">
            
            Semitic bias. <br id="r2l61">
