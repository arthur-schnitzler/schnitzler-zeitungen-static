            how painstakingly profound an art appears on every page of Schnitzler. Do the <br id="r1l7">
            
            young critics resent it that Schnitzler does not deal with the Great War and kindred <br id="r1l8">
            
            themes? To this criticism one need only reply that Der junge Medardus is ßlled with <br id="r1l9">
            
            war psychology of so convincing a character that it seems incredible this play was <br id="r1l10">
            
            written before 1014. Or is Schnitzler old-fashioned because he individualizes his <br id="r1l11">
            
            characters by giving them names instead of calling them “the husband, the wise, <br id="r1l12">
            
            the doctor'' as is customary in the modern drama? This objection can have little <br id="r1l13">
            
            weight because the mannerism of thus giving to the dramalis personde universal <br id="r1l14">
            
            signilicance is neither new in the history of literature nor without its own marked <br id="r1l15">
            
            limitations. Despite the fact that this Schnitzler play will probably not take its <br id="r1l16">
            
            place among the greatest the author has produced—I myself should place it beside <br id="r1l17">
            
            Zwischenspiel, below Liebelei and Der einsame Weg, but above Die Schwestern and <br id="r1l18">
            
            Komödie der Verführung—yet it is a delicate work of art from the pen of one ofthe <br id="r1l19">
            
            greatest contemporary dramatists, and deserves full recognition. <br id="r1l20">

            Virgil Moser belongs with Karl von Bahder, Otto Clemen, Alfred Goetze, A. <br id="r1l25">
            
            Hauffen, and others to that small group of scholars who have devoted their lives to <br id="r1l26">
            
            the scientißc study of Early Modern High German. He believes in the method of <br id="r1l27">
            
            the Young Grammarians, represented by Paul Braune, Sievers, Kluge, Rehaghel, <br id="r1l28">
            
            Osthoff, who have lately been made the target of attack by a new school of <br id="r1l29">
            
            philologists under the leadership of thie Romance philologist, Karl Vossler of Munich, <br id="r1l30">
            
            the author of" Positivismus und Idealismus in der Sprachwissenschaft,“ and other <br id="r1l31">
            
            more pungent articles. Moser, howgver, calls himself also a disciple of Konrad <br id="r1l32">
            
            Burdach in as much as he believes with him that the problem of the creation of the <br id="r1l33">
            
            Modern High German literary language was not solved by one single individual, <br id="r1l34">
            
            however forceful and dominating a personality he might represent, in our case <br id="r1l35">
            
            Martin Luther of legendary language fame, but that it was due to the combined <br id="r1l36">
            
            influence of a great many factors at work, linguistic, religious, political, colonial, etc., <br id="r1l37">
            
            as advocated as early as 1884 by Konrad Burdach in his habilitation lecture, Die <br id="r1l38">
            
            Einigung der neuhochdeutschen Schriftsprache,’ a most important piece of work <br id="r1l39">
            
            illustrating the more modern method of investigation for this puzzling probiem. <br id="r1l40">
            
            Konrad Burdach was looked upon by the adherents of the new school of <br id="r1l41">
            
            philologists as their patron saint, the idealistic scholar, while the Junggrammatiker <br id="r1l42">
            
            were dubbed materialists, or in Vossler’s idealistic language, Dachdecker um Osthoff, <br id="r1l43">
            
            roof layers arbund Osthoff. Burdach, however,jhas not been taken in completely by <br id="r1l44">
            
            this glorification of his ardent admirers; he has lately cut the cloth between them, <br id="r1l45">
            
            as they are no doubt over-shooting the mark. <br id="r1l46">
            
            Contrary to German custom Virgil Moser has never been connected in an <br id="r1l47">
            
            official way with a German university. He has lived in English fashion until recently <br id="r1l48">
            
            as a private scholar in Munich, in close touch indeed with the university and known <br id="r1l49">
            
            to all and consulted by all who were interested in sixteenth century studies, for <br id="r1l50">
            
            there is hardly a phase in the field of Early Modern High German to which Virgil <br id="r1l51">
            
            Moser has not in one form or another made valuable contributions. His outstanding <br id="r1l52">
            
            book was for a long time his Introduction tothe Early Modern High German Written <br id="r1l53">
            
            Dialects, which was published in 1000, but has been out of print since 1020. <br id="r1l54">
