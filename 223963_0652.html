            deeter, and# #e this plar proves, a keen <br id="r2l16">
            
            controversialist. <br id="r2l17">
            
            Professor Bernhardi <br id="r2l18">
            
            starts with the supreme advantage of “being <br id="r2l19">

            It is particularly inte¬ <br id="r2l21">

            Catholics. <br id="r2l23">
            
            The argument. reduced to its simplest <br id="r2l24">
            
            terms, is as follows. Professor Bernhardi. <br id="r2l25">
            
            the Jewish director of a Viennese hospital, <br id="r2l26">

            the patient has no iden that sheris dying. <br id="r2l29">
            
            As a doctor, he argues, his duty is to secure <br id="r2l30">
            
            a happv death-bed for the patient. TThe <br id="r2l31">
            
            sight of the priest would make her realise <br id="r2l32">

            Then, bit hy bit, all Vienna, where politics <br id="r2l35">
            
            abound, is set in an uprour over the cnse. <br id="r2l36">
            
            From a small ineident conducted with <br id="r2l37">
            
            courtesg on both sides, <br id="r2l38">

            anti-Semitie forces to oppose the doctor. <br id="r2l42">
            
            He is brought to trial, imprisoned for two <br id="r2l43">
            
            months, and we leave him as he is releasedl. <br id="r2l44">
            
            The play. like life. has no final settlement. <br id="r2l45">
