            ance, which, though handsome, is <br id="r1l22">
            
            so pronouncedly Oriental as to limit <br id="r1l23">
            
            the range of his parts. Six years <br id="r1l24">

            I am not aware that he is otherwise <br id="r1l27">
            
            known in the United States. Here, <br id="r1l28">
            
            though he has played with success <br id="r1l29">

            concerned, as a Shakespearean <br id="r1l32">

            opportunity that he has long de¬ <br id="r1l42">
            
            served. <br id="r1l43">
            
            The play, though it has been per¬ <br id="r1l44">
            
            formed only once before in Eng¬ <br id="r1l45">
            
            land, and then privately, is familiar <br id="r1l46">
            
            to students of the theatre; but it <br id="r1l47">
            
            has a special and renewed interest <br id="r1l48">
            
            at the present time. It opens with <br id="r1l49">
            
            a scene in which a Jewish director <br id="r1l50">
            
            of a Viennese hospital refuses to <br id="r1l51">
            
            allow a priest to have access to a <br id="r1l52">
            
            dying patient. He s#ays that the <br id="r1l53">
            
            patient is happy, that she does not <br id="r1l54">
            
            know she is dying, that the priest’s <br id="r1l55">
            
            arrival would put into her the fear <br id="r1l56">
            
            of death. At this point, I think, <br id="r1l57">
            
            Schnitzler missed an opportunity. <br id="r1l58">
            
            Because he was writing as an anti¬ <br id="r1l59">
            
            clerical Austrian, he never allows <br id="r1l60">
            
            the Catholic point of view on this <br id="r1l61">
            
            incident to be represented; instead, <br id="r1l62">
            
            he hurries on to the consequences <br id="r1l63">
            
            of the incident itself, showing how <br id="r1l64">
            
            from so small a seed there sprang <br id="r1l65">
            
            up a forest of intrigue. <br id="r1l66">
            
            Once launched on this subject, he <br id="r1l67">
            
            has the courage to examine it in all <br id="r1l68">
            
            its aspects, and the play becomes, <br id="r1l69">
            
            not simply a piece of Jewish and <br id="r1l70">
            
            anti-clerical propaganda, but a gen¬ <br id="r1l71">
            
            uine study of differing sets of <br id="r1l72">
            
            values. Bernhardi himself is by no <br id="r1l73">
            
            means exempt from criticism; his <br id="r1l74">
            
            stubborn refusal to compromise in <br id="r1l75">
            
            little things, his fanatical lack of <br id="r1l76">
            
            proportion, his special variety of <br id="r1l77">
            
            spiritual pride are set ouf side by <br id="r1l78">
            
            side with the excessive desire of <br id="r1l79">
            
            priests and politicians to excuse <br id="r1l80">
            
            their immediate failures or weak¬ <br id="r1l81">
            
            nesses by saying that it is often <br id="r1l82">
            
            necessary to subordinate the means <br id="r1l83">
            
            to the end. Schnitzler is not im¬ <br id="r1l84">
            
            partial; he has his own prejudice <br id="r1l85">
            
            and does not conceal it; but his <br id="r1l86">
            
            satire is by no means undistributed. <br id="r1l87">
            
            The result is a play of rare bal¬ <br id="r1l88">
            
            ance and subtlety and one that re¬ <br id="r1l89">
            
            wards every perceptive delicacy of <br id="r1l90">
