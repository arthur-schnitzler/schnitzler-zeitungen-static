            The play is little more than a series of conversa¬ <br id="r1l18">

            that theoriginal atmosphereand surroundings should <br id="r1l28">

            humour, observation, dramatic effect, and sensation¬ <br id="r1l48">

            instant later responsive laughter greets the grotesque¬ <br id="r1l51">
            
            ness of the situation. It is the period of the Terro <br id="r1l52">
            
            in Paris. To the Green Cockatoo, an undergrot <br id="r1l53">
            
            tavern kept by Prosper, formerly a theatrich <br id="r1l54">
            
            manager, aristocrats are flocking to enjoy a new <br id="r1l55">
            
            experience. Prosper has engaged a company of <br id="r1l56">
            
            needy actors and actresses. Their business is t <br id="r1l57">
            
            relate to his wealthy but dissolute clientele incident <br id="r1l58">
            
            which may or may not have occurred. Th <br id="r1l59">
            
            Ffor example, is suddenly invaded by a weird figur <br id="r1l60">
            
            who tells with intense realism how he is flying ir# <br id="r1l61">
            
            justice because he has taken his rival’s life; a mar <br id="r1l62">
            
            scizes his wile by the throat and endeavours to <br id="r1l63">
            
            strangle her because she has beon unfaithful. The <br id="r1l64">
            
            situation ends in a laugh or a taunt by the host thaf <br id="r1l65">
            
            it is not a bit like the real thing. <br id="r1l66">
            
            That comes later in an episode which stirs the <br id="r1l67">
            
            audience both on the stage and in front of the cur¬ <br id="r1l68">
            
            tain to a manifestation of unusual excitement. <br id="r1l69">
            
            Henri, a young actor, has just married Loocadie, an <br id="r1l70">
            
            actress, whose reputation is admittedly not of the <br id="r1l71">
            
            best. To that, however, he is fairly indifferent. <br id="r1l72">
            
            The two take their departure from the Cabaret. A <br id="r1l73">
            
            quarter of an hour later Henri reappears. He is <br id="r1l74">
            
            evidently a prey to profound emotion. With a <br id="r1l75">
            
            wenlth of gesture and in broken accents he relates <br id="r1l76">
            
            how he had surprised his wise with the Duc de <br id="r1l77">
            
            Cadignan in a situation which left no doubt as to <br id="r1l78">
            
            stheir guilt. Just then a turbulent crowd surges <br id="r1l79">
            
            in with the news that the Bastille has been taken, <br id="r1l80">
            
            that the pcople are triumphant. Momentarily we¬ <br id="r1l81">
            
            Tare led to imagine that the whole affair has neen <br id="r1l82">
            
            cleverly stage-managed by Prosper. But the fruch <br id="r1l83">
            
            is quickly out. Henri, meanwhile, has succesded <br id="r1l84">
            
            by his acting in deceiving even his friends, rhe <br id="r1l85">
            
            crowd round congratulating him on having cis¬ <br id="r1l86">
            
            covored Leocadie’s perüidy, which has been knowa <br id="r1l87">
            
            to them for long. The statement falls like a thundlor¬ <br id="r1l88">
            
            bolt upon him. Just then the Duc enters. The <br id="r1l89">
            
            infuriated Henri springs upon him and plunges a <br id="r1l90">
            
            dagger into his heart. The comedy is finished, and <br id="r1l91">
            
            the curtain falls. <br id="r1l92">
            
            In all this there is just a suspicion of theatricality. <br id="r1l93">
            
            But the story swings along at such a pace andthe <br id="r1l94">
            
            characterisation is so varied and excellent that <br id="r1l95">
            
            nothing else is heeded. Mr. Loon Quartermaine did <br id="r1l96">
            
            splendid work as Henri, while Mr. Luke Forster as <br id="r1l97">

            deal too risqué for the English stage, but at the <br id="r4l22">
            
            Aldwych, once Mrs. Grundy had been banished <br id="r4l23">
            
            from the mind, it was a little story full of charm. <br id="r4l24">
            
            We are introduced to a conversation between <br id="r4l25">
            
            Count Arpad Pazmandy and Prince Ravenstein. <br id="r4l26">
            
            The count, in spite of his youthful appearance, <br id="r4l27">
            
            is nearing the sixties; the prince is seven years <br id="r4l28">
            
            his junior. The count is feeling melancholy, <br id="r4l29">
            
            for Lolo Langhuber, the actress, with whom he <br id="r4l30">
            
            hjas had tender relations for years past, has <br id="r4l31">
            
            decided to settle down and marry, and the count, <br id="r4l32">
            
            awidower for many vears, tells his old friend how <br id="r4l33">
            
            much he will feel che parting. The prince, also <br id="r4l34">
            
            a widower, has in hhis turn a confidence to make, <br id="r4l35">
            
            much more startling.-He has a son of seventeen <br id="r4l36">
            
            whom nobody has ever heard of, and has de¬ <br id="r4l37">
            
            eided that, the young man shall bear his name. <br id="r4l38">
            
            He will be along shortly. The count, in his <br id="r4l39">
            
            mood of melancholy, inquires tenderly after the <br id="r4l40">
            
            mother, and hears that she died years ago. <br id="r4l41">
            
            THE COUNTS DAUGHTER. <br id="r4l42">
            
            Then the Comtesse Mizzi, the Count’s gentle <br id="r4l43">
            
            daughter, comes on the scene. Unmarried and <br id="r4l44">
            
            well on in the thirties, she has been a cause of <br id="r4l45">
            
            some concern to the Count, who cannot under¬ <br id="r4l46">
            
            stand why she has refused so many suiters. He¬ <br id="r4l47">
            
            puts it down to the fact that she is so much <br id="r4l48">
            
            wrapped up in her art of painting. But the <br id="r4l49">
            
            Count once out of the way, the Prince gives a <br id="r4l50">
            
            startling piece of news to the Comtesse and to <br id="r4l51">
            
            the audience. That day she will see“ her? <br id="r4l52">
            
            son. The gentle Comtesse declares with passion <br id="r4l53">
            
            that she does not want to. If in the days when <br id="r4l54">
            
            the Prince's wife was alive he had been <br id="r4l55">
            
            courageous enough, as she would have been, <br id="r4l56">
            
            to let the world know what had happened, they <br id="r4l57">
            
            could have gone awav and faced the world all <br id="r4l58">
            
            three together. But her baby was taken away <br id="r4l59">
            
            from her when he was only a few days old. She <br id="r4l60">
            
            had to suffer that shock, and now all love for her <br id="r4l61">
            
            son and his father is dead. The Prince asks her <br id="r4l62">
            
            to marry him, as he has done before, but she will <br id="r4l63">
            
            not hear of it. And here we learn that the <br id="r4l64">
            
            Comtesse Mizzi, who to her father has always <br id="r4l65">
            
            appeared a type of resigned and happy spinster¬ <br id="r4l66">
            
            hood, has not let the years pass over her head <br id="r4l67">
            
            without“ compensations.“ <br id="r4l68">
            
            The Prince knows it, <br id="r4l69">
            
            too, but he is wishful to marry her all the <br id="r4l70">
            
            same. <br id="r4l71">
            
            The youth Philip comes, gay and sparkling, <br id="r4l72">
            
            and we see that the inflexibility of the Comtesse <br id="r4l73">
            
            is rapidly disappearing. It all ends with a pro¬ <br id="r4l74">
            
            posal for evervbody to go to Ostend, where we <br id="r4l75">
            
            are sure that the Comtesse will decide to become <br id="r4l76">
            
            a mother tothe voung man. The play was helped <br id="r4l77">
            
            enormously by the sympathetie character of the <br id="r4l78">
            
            actors. Mr. Robert Horton and Mr. Athol Stewart, <br id="r4l79">
            
            as the Count and the Prince respectively, made <br id="r4l80">
            
            two most convincing and kindly aristoorats. Miss <br id="r4l81">
            
            Katherine Pole was a charming Mizzi, and Miss <br id="r4l82">
            
            Margaret Bussé, as the actress Lolo from whom <br id="r4l83">
            
            the Count parts with melancholy, gave an admir¬ <br id="r4l84">
            
            able study in her frank conversation with Mizzi. <br id="r4l85">
            
            THE GREEN COCKATOO.“ <br id="r4l86">
            
            Whatever objections Mrs. Grundy might find <br id="r4l87">
            
            ir this piece are not present in the second play, <br id="r4l88">
            
            The Green Cockatoo, a grotesque, as it 18 <br id="r4l89">
            
            called. It is a most powerful piece of work, and <br id="r4l90">
            
            shows a disreputable tavern frequented by the <br id="r4l91">
            
            French aristocracy ef 1789. Here the exquisites <br id="r4l92">
            
            come to mix with a rabble of actors who play at <br id="r4l93">

            their ladies are called scum and pigs, and the <br id="r4l95">
            
            aristocrats enjoy the joke immensely. <br id="r4l96">
