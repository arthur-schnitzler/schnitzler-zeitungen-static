            This play, which, as we understand, Is very success¬ <br id="r2l1">
            
            Pful in Austria and Germany, has a simple story. <br id="r2l2">
            
            Fritz Lobheimer, an oflleer in an Austrian Dragoon <br id="r2l3">
            
            regiment, has been carrging on an intrigue with a <br id="r2l4">
            
            married woman, and another at the same time with <br id="r2l5">
            
            Christine, the daughter of old Hans Weiring, a <br id="r2l6">
            
            violinist in a theatre orchestra. The husband of <br id="r2l7">
            
            the married woman challenges him and kills him; <br id="r2l8">
            
            and Christine, on learning the news, rushes out in <br id="r2l9">
            
            despair, to commit, as we are led to believe, suielde. <br id="r2l10">
            
            That is the skeleton—simple, and strong enough to <br id="r2l11">
            
            bear a body of genuine tragedy. Towards clothing <br id="r2l12">
            
            it with genuine tragedy the author has gone a good <br id="r2l13">
            
            way. We learn very early in the play that Christine <br id="r2l14">
            
            is not like her friend Mizi Schlager, a mere light¬ <br id="r2l15">
            
            o'-love, despising all men, but equally ready to take <br id="r2l16">
            
            any lover she can get and to bid him a cheerful <br id="r2l17">
            
            good-bye when she can kcep him no longer. Christine <br id="r2l18">
            
            takes the affair very seriously. She has in her a pretty <br id="r2l19">
            
            strong dose of the will to keep. Fritz in her first <br id="r2l20">
            
            lover—for hitherto she has been quite respectable—. <br id="r2l21">
            
            and he will be her last. Fritz looks at the matter <br id="r2l22">
            
            in atotally different light. Even atthe merry supper¬ <br id="r2l23">
            
            party in the first act his head is at least as full of <br id="r2l24">
            
            the married woman as of Christine. And after that <br id="r2l25">
            
            party (Fritz is entertaining bis friend Theodor Kaiser <br id="r2l26">
            
            and Theodor’s“ friend'' Mizi, and Christine, and they <br id="r2l27">
            
            have been drinking Bruderschaff and doing all sorts <br id="r2l28">
            
            of amusing Austrian things) has been interrupted by <br id="r2l29">
            
            the enraged husband with his challenge, he has, of <br id="r2l30">
            
            course, an additional reason for insisting to Christine <br id="r2l31">
            
            that this sort of thing is only temporary. It <br id="r2l32">
            
            is all no use. The will to keep in Christine is only <br id="r2l33">
            
            intensified in the second act by Fritz's very charming <br id="r2l34">
            
            way of aying what he knows, but Christine does not <br id="r2l35">
            
            know, to be probably a last farewell, vowing (what <br id="r2l36">
            
            was doubtless true at the moment) that he really did <br id="r2l37">
            
            love her. And so it happens that in the third act, <br id="r2l38">
            
            when the news is brought to the girl that her lover is <br id="r2l39">
            
            not only dead, but has been shot in a duel about <br id="r2l40">
            
            another woman, she is driven practically mad by her <br id="r2l41">
            
            loss. <br id="r2l42">
            
            Madness, it has been sal“, is only exaggerated <br id="r2l43">
            
            selfishness. It may be so; in any case the <br id="r2l44">
            
            madness—that is, the character—of Christine is just <br id="r2l45">
            
            what, in our opinion, has prevented this play from <br id="r2l46">
            
            becoming a genuine tragedy. It has affected it in <br id="r2l47">
            
            #two ways. The first, and least important, is this <br id="r2l48">
            
            Christine has been, all along, a negative person. <br id="r2l49">
            
            She appeared to have only one positive quality— <br id="r2l50">
            
            that pretty strong dose of the will to keep. And so, <br id="r2l51">
            
            when this negative, inarticulate creature suddenly <br id="r2l52">
            
            breaks into eloquence and pours out, disjointedly <br id="r2l53">
            
            but with acute point, rage and scorn and grief, we <br id="r2l54">
            
            feel that this is not Christine herself speaking, but <br id="r2l55">
            
            the author. The girl herself—at any rate, as we saw <br id="r2l56">
            
            her yesterday—might feel these things dimly, but <br id="r2l57">
            
            she never could say them. It is the auther who feels <br id="r2l58">
            
            them acutely for her, and uses her inappropriate <br id="r2l59">
            
            mouth forthe expression of them. A more important <br id="r2l60">
            
            matter is this, that we sce in Christine no trace of <br id="r2l61">
            
            regret for the man who is dead. Not a single“ Poor <br id="r2l62">
            
            Fritz!“ passes her lips. It is herself she is thinking <br id="r2l63">
            
            of, the slight put upen her by the intrigue with the <br id="r2l64">
            
            other woman, the fact that Fritz on his way to the <br id="r2l65">
            
            duel talked to Theodor of other people and things <br id="r2l66">
            
            besides herself; and these are the subject of her <br id="r2l67">
            
            outburst. So Christine sbrivels under our eyes. <br id="r2l68">
            
            Her sorrow is only an intensification of that¬ <br id="r2l69">
            
            “ worriting“ to which we had scen her subject her <br id="r2l70">
            
            lover before; and tragedy is not made of women like <br id="r2l71">
            
            this. <br id="r2l72">
            
            Still. the play is a sincere, artfully-constructed, <br id="r2l73">
            
            and occasionally moving piece of work; and it is <br id="r2l74">
            
            admirably acted under the superintendence of Herr <br id="r2l75">
            
            Max Behrend. We suspect that Fritz was intended <br id="r2l76">
            
            by the author to he rather more of a“ gay dog? <br id="r2l77">
            
            and rather less of a romantic hero than he was made <br id="r2l78">
            
            by Mr. Ainley; but, granted his view of the character, <br id="r2l79">
            
            Mr. Ainler acted it almost to perfection. Miss <br id="r2l80">
            
            Margaret Halstan, too, did well, though she failed to <br id="r2l81">
            
            find a way of reconciling the two Christines. The <br id="r2l82">
            
            part of her father, played by Mr. Hignett, was only <br id="r2l83">
            
            saved from conventionality by the straightforward <br id="r2l84">
            
            views the old gentleman hadto express onthe ultimate <br id="r2l85">
            
            value of respectability in youth, and to these Mr. <br id="r2l86">
            
            Hignett gave their full virtue. Mr. Charles Maude <br id="r2l87">
            
            and Miss Margaret Bussé romped delightfully as a <br id="r2l88">
            
            pair of light-o'-loves, and in serious moments the <br id="r2l89">
            
            former showed more than the promise of a very <br id="r2l90">
            
            capable actor. Mr. James Hearn made an intensely <br id="r2l91">
            
            vivid thing of his five minutes’ scene as the infuriated <br id="r2l92">
            
            husband, and Miss Sydney Fairbrother, as a sharp¬ <br id="r2l93">
            
            tongued neighbour, showed an art and a finish equal <br id="r2l94">
            
            to Mr. Heamn's. The play will be repeated at His <br id="r2l95">
            
            Majesty's Theatre on the afternoons of Tuesday andf <br id="r2l96">
