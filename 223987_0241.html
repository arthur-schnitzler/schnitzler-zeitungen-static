            tragedian, newly wedded to Leocadie, and <br id="r3l51">

            üthe Duc, he hardly realised that, in a few <br id="r3l53">
            
            minutes, he would hear that what he had <br id="r3l54">
            
            mimieked was the truth. The truth which im¬ <br id="r3l55">
            
            pelled real murder when the Dukercame to <br id="r3l56">
            
            the cellar to join his companions, who ap¬ <br id="r3l57">
            
            plauded when he fell at his effort in acting. <br id="r3l58">
            
            Nor would they believe the manisc when he <br id="r3l59">

            have gone on carousing with their folk <br id="r3l63">
            
            enemies. Now they beat a hasty retreat. Let <br id="r3l64">
            
            them go, said the companions, their time will. <br id="r3l65">
            
            come eure enough. It was weird and wonder¬ <br id="r3l66">
            
            ful. It taxed the brain, it kindled imagina¬ <br id="r3l67">
            
            tion. How mad, yet how tragic it was. What, <br id="r3l68">
            
            boldness of dramatie painting—it reminded <br id="r3l69">
            
            oue of Meissonier—painted in words; and the <br id="r3l70">
            
            translation of Miss Penelope Wheeler never <br id="r3l71">
            
            betraved foreign origin. It might have been <br id="r3l72">
            
            an English play; I wish it had been that and <br id="r3l73">
            
            just a little shorter.“ <br id="r3l74">
            
            It may seem to my r#ader that this come¬ <br id="r3l75">
            
            what enthusiastic impression was derived from <br id="r3l76">
            
            the production at the Vaudeville. And I wish <br id="r3l77">
            
            that I could give the reply affirmative. But, <br id="r3l78">
            
            unfortunately, what I write above is the ap¬ <br id="r3l79">
            
            preciation of the remarkable production of <br id="r3l80">
            
            the Stage Society, which introduced Schnitz¬ <br id="r3l81">
            
            ler’s work to England. Although it was in no <br id="r3l82">
            
            wise perfect, there was at least an attempt ab <br id="r3l83">
            
            orchestration of voice and situations; there <br id="r3l84">
            
            was, to a certain extent, to be observed thef <br id="r3l85">
            
            dominating hand of a stage manager with a <br id="r3l86">
            
            definite conception of the play. In the re¬ <br id="r3l87">
            
            vival there was nothing of that kind; it was <br id="r3l88">
            
            a pieture of the French Revolution as it has <br id="r3l89">
            
            lived for years in ridiculous absurdity in the <br id="r3l90">
            
            traditions of the theatre. The French Revo¬ <br id="r3l91">
            
            Iution was emphatically not an orgy of beer <br id="r3l92">
            
            and alcohol, it, was an orgy of fanaticism, <br id="r3l93">
            
            roused by the oppression of centuries. The <br id="r3l94">
            
            artist who wishes to pieture this on the stage <br id="r3l95">
            
            should bear in mind the difference of effect: <br id="r3l96">
            
            mere drunkenness leads to hullabaloo, <br id="r3l97">
            
            freuetic enthusiasm for a cause graduates into <br id="r3l98">
            
            #tumult like a rising etorm. At the Vande¬ <br id="r3l99">
            
            ville it was all noise, to say nothing of the <br id="r3l100">
            
            handicap of a small stage and clumsy setting. <br id="r3l101">
            
            Words were drowned and characters seemed <br id="r3l102">
            
            toexpress themselves powerlessly in general <br id="r3l103">
            
            vociferation. Such as could rise above the <br id="r3l104">
            
            din, like Mr. Norman MeKinnel, powerkul <br id="r3l105">
            
            as the actor, like the Duke of Mr. Malcolm <br id="r3l106">
            
            Cherry, a figure of distinction in a motley <br id="r3l107">
            
            stmosphere, left fragmentary impressions of <br id="r3l108">
            
            what the play really was. But, on the whole, <br id="r3l109">
            
            Schnitzler’s work had become melodrama in¬ <br id="r3l110">
            
            stead of a subtie vision in miniature of a new <br id="r3l111">
