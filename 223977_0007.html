            16.3. Die letzten sken <br id="r1l2">
            
            this, of course, is a ghastly basis for a play. We learn <br id="r1l3">
            
            the nature of his wish from the fact that in a very strained <br id="r1l4">
            
            scene he rehearses with Florian Schubart bis proposed specch. <br id="r1l5">
            
            Weibgart arrives; he behaves amiably, though in manner (and <br id="r1l6">
            
            this is a question of stage direction or acting) he is objectionably <br id="r1l7">
            
            fatuous and patronising. The audience expects the explosion, <br id="r1l8">
            
            none happens. There are long silences, and the scene ends with <br id="r1l9">
            
            Weihgart going in peace, whilst the play closes with the death of <br id="r1l10">
            
            Rademacher. What is exactly the explanation of the dying <br id="r1l11">
            
            journalist’s conduct one can only guess, aided by a last word or <br id="r1l12">
            
            two. Even now I am doubtful whether he was silent because of <br id="r1l13">
            
            the kind speeches of his former friend or because some moral <br id="r1l14">
            
            change caused by his illness drove away his evil wish. In some <br id="r1l15">
            
            respects the play is powerful, but it points towards a goal that is <br id="r1l16">
            
            never reached. There are nice reticences and agreeable hints and <br id="r1l17">
            
            suggestions of character, but the audience is too puzzled for deep <br id="r1l18">
            
            feeling. What a pity that one cannot build big things with <br id="r1l19">
            
            negatives! Still, the work heldthe house very well. This toa <br id="r1l20">
            
            great extent was due to the admirable acting of Mr. J. D. <br id="r1l21">
            
            Beveridge in the character of the dying man. Mr. George <br id="r1l22">
            
            Trollope's work was skilful as the consumptive patient, and Miss <br id="r1l23">
            
            Isabel Grey showed some cleverness as a nurse. <br id="r1l24">
            
            The programnne ended with a joke by Mr. Bernard Shaw, <br id="r1l25">
            
            entitled“ How He Liedto Her Husband,“ a droll piece with onc <br id="r1l26">
            
            excellent comic idea, but some humours that refused to keep <br id="r1l27">
            
            within bounds. For the general public can hardly be expected to <br id="r1l28">
            
            have a sufficient acquaintance with“ Candida to enjoy one or <br id="r1l29">
            
            two of the points. It opened a little tamely. There is a young <br id="r1l30">
            
            poet and the wife of a rich man in the City, who arc as lover-like <br id="r1l31">
            
            as actual chastity will permit. She was in a state of great anziety <br id="r1l32">
            
            because some poems of his written to her as Aurora had got into <br id="r1l33">
            
            the hands of her sister-in-law and were very compromising, and <br id="r1l34">
            
            she was fearful of a row. He, with high-sounding speeches, <br id="r1l35">
            
            suggested that they would simply tell the truth and go away and <br id="r1l36">
            
            live together. She tock another view and persuaded him to <br id="r1l37">
            
            promise to behave“ like a gentleman and a man: of honour, and <br id="r1l38">
            
            deny that the poems were written to her. The husband came <br id="r1l39">
            
            on. The lover lied, the husband disbelieved him, the lover <br id="r1l40">
            
            persisted; and as the lover embellished his lies by assertions that <br id="r1l41">
            
            he did not admire the lady, the husband grew madiy wrathful at the <br id="r1l42">
            
            slight upon her charms. Here was a really comic idea, capitally <br id="r1l43">
            
            carried out—extravagant, no doubt, but that does not matter. <br id="r1l44">
            
            The husband’s wrath at the insult to Aurora’s charms reached <br id="r1l45">
            
            such a pitch that therc was a scuffle, a touch of needless physical <br id="r1l46">
            
            violence. The wife came in, and, guessing the absurd truth, made <br id="r1l47">
            
            the men shake hands; then the lover admitted his guilt, the <br id="r1l48">
            
            husband apologised, and asked permission to publish the poetry, <br id="r1l49">
            
            and so the joke ended—a capital joke, a trifle small, a little too <br id="r1l50">
            
            #much in a groove. Fortunately Miss Certrude Kingston acted <br id="r1l51">
            
            perlectly ás the wife. Mr.Granville Barker mimicked very <br id="r1l52">
            
            cleverlv his performance in“ Candida, and the husband’s part <br id="r1l53">
            
            E. F. S. <br id="r1l54">
            
            was admirably played by Mr. Poulton. <br id="r1l55">
            
            HIS MAIESTY'S THEATRE. <br id="r1l56">
            
            The“ Academy of Dramatic Art“' which Mr. Tree has estab¬ <br id="r1l57">
            
            lished made its first public appearance yesterday afternoon, and at <br id="r1l58">
            
            the fall of the curtain for the last time Mr. Tree announced that <br id="r1l59">
            
            there would be another performance this season. Thus will <br id="r1l60">
            
            instruction be leavened by practical experience; and the experi¬ <br id="r1l61">
            
            ence gained on so large a stage and in so large a house will <br id="r1l62">
            
            undoubtedly give this Academy a considerable advantage over the <br id="r1l63">
            
            other similar institutions of which less has been heard. The venture <br id="r1l64">
            
            has been discussed from all points of view, and I imagine nobody <br id="r1l65">
            
            pretends that it will produce genius; but when genius comes <br id="r1l66">

            nor the greatest, yet shall it be considered <br id="r2l11">
            
            first here—to tempt the reader into going <br id="r2l12">
            
            to see it. Were it not written by Mr. <br id="r2l13">
            
            Shaw, it should have been written by <br id="r2l14">
            
            Georgina. Who is she? A nasty. <br id="r2l15">
            
            vulgar-minded cat,“ says her sister-in¬ <br id="r2l16">
            
            law, Aurora. But we—and Mr. Shaw— <br id="r2l17">
            
            know better. Georgina is just “a dear“ <br id="r2l18">
            
            —virtuous, and nothing if not proper. <br id="r2l19">
            
            What is she to do, then, when she finds <br id="r2l20">
            
            a bundle of passionate poems addressed <br id="r2l21">
            
            to Aurora—and in manuscript, too? They <br id="r2l22">
            
            were written by young Apjohn, Auroras <br id="r2l23">
            
            lover and are of a kind that only a <br id="r2l24">
            
            married woman should read. Georgina <br id="r2l25">
            
            does her dutv, and hands them to her <br id="r2l26">
            
            brother, Mr. Edward Bumpus, Aurora's <br id="r2l27">
            
            husband. <br id="r2l28">
            
            Here, then, the comedy begins, though <br id="r2l29">
            
            it had a prelude when Apjohn and Aurora <br id="r2l30">

            7 <br id="r2l38">

            half-baked clergyman“ in Candida — <br id="r2l40">
            
            and she hates scandal. So she weeps a <br id="r2l41">

            the stricken youth promises to act <br id="r2l43">
            
            honorably like a gentleman and lie for <br id="r2l44">

            course, is G. B. S.“ all over, but there is <br id="r2l46">
            
            more. For Bumpus, that commercial¬ <br id="r2l47">
            
            minded man, is a perverse person, whio <br id="r2l48">

            and indifferent to my wife!“ he exclaims <br id="r2l51">
            
            to the poet. Yon insolent puppy.“ <br id="r2l52">
            
            the lover’s lying is all to no purpose, and <br id="r2l53">
            
            rumpus ensues. Bumpus, as Aurora <br id="r2l54">
            
            explains, is a handy name for poetic pur¬ <br id="r2l55">
            
            Only <br id="r2l56">
            
            poses; it rhymes with“ rumpus.“ <br id="r2l57">
            
            when Apjohn tells the truth can husband <br id="r2l58">
