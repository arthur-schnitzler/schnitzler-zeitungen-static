            This theme is convincingly and <br id="r1l43">
            
            faithfully discussed by the author, <br id="r1l44">

            A moving portrayal of Bernhardi is <br id="r1l49">
            
            given by Mr. Abraham Sofaer, but it <br id="r1l50">
            
            is not a faultless portraval. It is <br id="r1l51">
            
            obviously a very thoughtful piece of <br id="r1l52">
            
            acting, and displays admirably the <br id="r1l53">
            
            character's integrity, absolute candour <br id="r1l54">
            
            (sometimes to the peint of indisere¬ <br id="r1l55">
            
            tion), and bitterness. At the same <br id="r1l56">
            
            time, there is, if anything, too much <br id="r1l57">
            
            reserve, too great a restraint in the <br id="r1l58">
            
            painting of a character who certainly <br id="r1l59">
            
            did not regard himself as a figure of <br id="r1l60">
            
            great nobility, but was looked upon as <br id="r1l61">

            which would have been insupportable. <br id="r1l64">
            
            Mr. Sofaer has inclined too much to <br id="r1l65">
            
            the other extreme. <br id="r1l66">

            eral maintains a refreshingly high <br id="r1l68">
            
            level, and there is no performance <br id="r1l69">
            
            that does not ring true. So well do <br id="r1l70">
            
            the actors co-operate that it is difficult <br id="r1l71">
            
            to select any individual performance <br id="r1l72">

            it would be better to say, human. <br id="r2l50">
            
            Professor Bernhardi is a doctor who, for purely human <br id="r2l51">
            
            motives, refuses to admit a priest to administer the last <br id="r2l52">
            
            sacred rites to a woman who is dying in a Viennese <br id="r2l53">
            
            hospital. He knows that, she is happy, and does not <br id="r2l54">
            
            understand how near she is to death, and he believes <br id="r2l55">
            
            that the priest would agitate her and frighten her. The <br id="r2l56">
            
            priest, seeing only the view of his Church, believes that <br id="r2l57">
            
            Uhe action of the doclor has imperilled the woman's <br id="r2l58">
            
            soul. The case is given much publicity. People take <br id="r2l59">
            
            sides. Because Bernhardi is a Jew social and political <br id="r2l60">
            
            iseues are dragged in. The doctor is charged with <br id="r2l61">
            
            Religioüs. obstruction, is tried, and sent to prison. <br id="r2l62">
            
            The author elaborates something which seems to begin! <br id="r2l63">
            
            as à small personal differenee until it becomes an affail <br id="r2l64">
            
            that looses angry passions and swells into something <br id="r2l65">
            
            that approaches a political war in a way both subtle and <br id="r2l66">
            
            dramatic. The result is a challenging play of a kind to <br id="r2l67">
            
            set people thinking as well as talking. And although <br id="r2l68">
            
            Arthur Schnitzler is obviouslv on the side of the doctor, <br id="r2l69">
            
            he does not unfairly weigh the scales against the priest. <br id="r2l70">
            
            HIe sets himself to attack intolerance, vet ends with u <br id="r2l71">
            
            whimsical twist to suggest that the“ well-meaning man,) <br id="r2l72">
            
            out to speak the truth as he sees it. and determined to <br id="r2l73">
            
            press home his honest purpose at all costs, mag do morz <br id="r2l74">
            
            harm than good after all. <br id="r2l75">
            
            The author has not allowed his antagonists to be merelt <br id="r2l76">
            
            mouthpieces, points of view on two legs. They are human <br id="r2l77">
            
            Hesh and blood. And the rest of the characters, even <br id="r2l78">
            
            the smallest, are so neatly, drawn that they must aff <br id="r2l79">
            
            live in the hands of capable actors, and all the actors <br id="r2l80">
            
            are mnoré than capablé in the Embassy cast. As the <br id="r2l81">
            
            doctor Mr. Abraham Sofaer shows the sincerity and the <br id="r2l82">
            
            straight purpose of the man. As the priest Mr. Bernard <br id="r2l83">
            
            Merefield is equally sincere and human; he makes von <br id="r2l84">
            
            zee his point of view. Others who are outstanding in <br id="r2l85">
            
            the smaller parts are Mr. Ronald Adam, Mr. John Gar¬ <br id="r2l86">
