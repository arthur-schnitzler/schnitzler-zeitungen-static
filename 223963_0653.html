            DRAMATIC EXAMINATION OF JEW-HATRED <br id="r1l15">
            
            The Embassy Theatre is to be congratulated upon presenting to <br id="r1l16">
            
            London the most intellectually gripping and stinulating drama to be <br id="r1l17">
            
            seen on the Metropolitan stage to-day. The fact that Schnitzler’s <br id="r1l18">
            
            * Professor Bernhardi’ was written some forty years ago and that it is <br id="r1l19">
            
            as topical and applicable almost in all respects as it was when first <br id="r1l20">
            
            conceived, results partly from its being a play which deals with <br id="r1l21">
            
            essentials in human nature, and partly because it deals with that <br id="r1l22">
            
            invariable symptom of inflamed and morbid Nationalism—anti¬ <br id="r1l23">
            
            Semitism. <br id="r1l24">
            
            The story is perfectly suited fo development towards dramatie <br id="r1l25">
            
            intensitv, starting as it does from a small ineident whien the Professor, <br id="r1l26">
            
            head of a hospital, refuses to allow a priest to visit a dying patient to <br id="r1l27">
            
            adninister the last sacrament. His reason was that the patient, having <br id="r1l28">
            
            reached that state of feeling perfectly well, which sometimes forms the <br id="r1l29">
            
            immedliate prelude to death, was enjoving a short period of intense happi¬ <br id="r1l30">
            
            ness, which would have been spoilt by the appearance of a priest suggest¬ <br id="r1l31">
            
            ing that her end was inevitable. Thie Professor thus refused to allow his <br id="r1l32">
            
            patient'’s last hours to be made unhappy. This ineident is seized upon by <br id="r1l33">
            
            the mang who hate the Professor by reason of jealousy, or because of some <br id="r1l34">
            
            pettr grudge, or merely because he is a Jew, to beat up a first-rate <br id="r1l35">
            
            political scandal. From this small ineident, the story broadens out as <br id="r1l36">
            
            inore and more branches of human rascality seize upon it, flagrantly <br id="r1l37">
            
            prostituting the religion they pretend to be protecting, and accusing the <br id="r1l38">
            
            Professor of an anti-Christian action. He is betrayed by a former friend, <br id="r1l39">
            
            who has wormed his way high up in polites into being Minister of Culture, <br id="r1l40">
            
            und eventually is proseested, convicted and sentenced to two monthe' <br id="r1l41">
            
            Inprisonment. <br id="r1l42">
            
            Not the least interest in the play is the excellent balance whlich the <br id="r1l43">
            
            author maintains between the Professor, the protagonist for truth, merey <br id="r1l44">
            
            and reason, and his intelligent opponent, the priest, who is quite naturally <br id="r1l45">
            
            convineed that the Professor’s action was wrong, since, according to his <br id="r1l46">
            
            belief, the patient was given a few minutes’ happiness at the expense of a <br id="r1l47">
            
            greut tüne of discomfort in the regions of the soul after deatn. Here <br id="r1l48">
            
            is the very finest kind of controversy, between two sincere opponents, <br id="r1l49">
            
            both, granted their preinises, reasonable in their arguments. <br id="r1l50">
            
            But this is not the real message of the play, which is an opportunity <br id="r1l51">
            
            for frong and stinging commentary on certain detestable traits in human <br id="r1l52">
            
            nature. Schnitzler’s purpose is to reveal the mean and contemptible <br id="r1l53">
            
            rassalitg which is called forth by an incident such as the controversy <br id="r1l54">
            
            between Berhardi and the priest among the canaille of all classes; the <br id="r1l55">
            
            swindling politiclan who“ gasses abeut ultimate and greater good while <br id="r1l56">
            
            all the tine he is feathering his own nest and purely interested in his own <br id="r1l57">
            
            selfish aims, pursuing them with a complete disregard for truthifulness, <br id="r1l58">
            
            honour and faith; the vicious and eswardlly assistant director of the <br id="r1l59">
            
            hospital, whose green envy surges up into gloating persecution of his <br id="r1l60">
            
            jealousle-hated superior, perseeution tricked out in all the fatuous <br id="r1l61">
            
            hypoerisy of the Germnan Jew-huter; thie crawling treachery of the Jew <br id="r1l62">
            
            deserter who wants to show himself more of an anti-Semite than his most <br id="r1l63">
            
            degraded non-Jewish Jew-hater; the franklg opportunist goverminent <br id="r1l64">
            
            careerist who, least objectionable of them all, openly admits that ouly a <br id="r1l65">
            
            fool tells the truth when a lie is popular—these are the meat and bones of <br id="r1l66">
            
            the play. It is no case of a struggle between the Jewish doctor’s <br id="r1l67">
            
            rationalism and the priest’s Christian faith, as might superficially appear. <br id="r1l68">
            
            It is the fight between all that is comprised by the phirase-ethical decency. <br id="r1l69">
            
            and all that should be included in the concept of thie fonl liend. <br id="r1l70">
            
            Polities in this play, as is so often the case on the Continent, and <br id="r1l71">
            
            not seldom the case in this countrv, is thie synonym for all that is <br id="r1l72">
            
            mnean, treacherous, unserupulous and selfish. It is interesting to recall <br id="r1l73">
            
            the words of an authoritative writer on that subtle English political <br id="r1l74">

            aspects, he said that it might be regarded, in one respect, 'as a perpetunl <br id="r1l76">
