            eyes followed the moving flashlight, <br id="r3l100">
            
            passing along the dead body. Was it <br id="r3l101">
            
            her body? — the wonderful, alluring <br id="r3l102">
            
            body for which, only yesterday, he <br id="r3l103">
            
            had felt such agonizing desire? Fri¬ <br id="r3l104">

            cheeks, the shoulders and arms of the <br id="r3l106">
            
            dead woman, doing so as if compelled <br id="r3l107">
            
            and directed by an invisible power. <br id="r3l108">
            
            He twined his fingers about those of <br id="r3l109">
            
            the corpse and, rigid as they were, <br id="r3l110">
            
            they seemed to him to make an ef¬ <br id="r3l111">

            distant look from underneath her <br id="r3l114">

            bent over her, as if magically at¬ <br id="r3l116">
            
            tracted. <br id="r3l117">

            Fridolin regained his senses in¬ <br id="r3l121">
            
            stantly. He freed his fingers from <br id="r3l122">
            
            those of the corpse and, taking her <br id="r3l123">
            
            thin wrists, placed the ice cold arms <br id="r3l124">
            
            alongside of the body very carefully, <br id="r3l125">
            
            even a little scrupulously. It seemed <br id="r3l126">
