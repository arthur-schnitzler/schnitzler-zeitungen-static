            Tuesdar and Thursday afternoons. The play ocals with a subject which <br id="r3l5">
            
            is supposed, more than any other, to monopolise all dramatists —Love, <br id="r3l6">
            
            Unfortunately, however, our British dramatists scarcely ever deal with it <br id="r3l7">
            
            sincerelz. Mr. Barrie generally toys daintily with it; Mr. Shaw tackles it <br id="r3l8">
            
            scientiticall, and coolly as a sort of intellectual phenomenon; most of our <br id="r3l9">
            
            plapwrights treat it as no more than something rather pretty and decorative ! <br id="r3l10">
            
            in a sentimental war. We have to go back two years for an English play <br id="r3l11">
            
            in which vne passiem ofa man and a woman was represented in anything <br id="r3l12">
            
            like its #atural power. That, ## was“ John Glayde’s Honour,’ and even <br id="r3l13">

            few minutes of the last act.“ Light o' Love,?' on the other hand, deals <br id="r3l15">
            
            with the subject with a stark sincerity. We can casily credit the stor# <br id="r3l16">
            
            of the succees it has had in Austria; and we wish we could believe that a <br id="r3l17">
            
            plag so poignant and so sincere was sure of a similar success here. In this <br id="r3l18">
            
            countre the majority of playgoers are still content wath a superficial <br id="r3l19">
            
            handling of human nature. There is, however a rapidlv-growing bodv ol <br id="r3l20">
            
            London theatre-goers who are asking for Reality, and these should crowd <br id="r3l21">

            The storv of“ Light o’ Love“’ can be told in a sentence or two.A <br id="r3l24">
            
            voung girl, Christine Weiring, the daughter of a fiddier in a Viennese theatre <br id="r3l25">
            
            orchestra, falls in love with Fritz Lobheimer, a voung officer of agreeable <br id="r3l26">
            
            presence and manners. Unknown to her he has been carrying on a <br id="r3l27">
            
            liaison with the wife of a man of his own class, and the husband has dis¬ <br id="r3l28">
            
            covered it, has challenged him to a duel, and he is killed. Christine hears <br id="r3l29">
            
            ofhis death and of the circumstances which have led ap to it; gradua'ly <br id="r3l30">
            
            realises the little part which, after all, she has played in nis life; and inshes <br id="r3l31">
            
            forth, torn with grief and shame, to destroy herself on his grave. That is <br id="r3l32">
            
            all. <br id="r3l33">

            was required in putting it together. But for all that“ Light o'Love? is <br id="r3l35">
            
            adramatic masterpiece, for there is not ; scene, and scarrely a line in st <br id="r3l36">

            A Pakr FoR A GRkar ACTRESS. <br id="r3l39">
            
            The part of Christine is one that the greatest of actresses might be proud <br id="r3l40">
            
            to play. Her tenderness, her simplicitr, her beautv,-which is the admira¬ <br id="r3l41">

            to her, her readiness to give all, her gratitude for a smile or a soft tone, <br id="r3l43">
            
            her love of her father, from whom for the first time in her life-she finds <br id="r3l44">

            being outside so many of his interests and so much of his life--these and a¬ <br id="r3l46">
            
            score of other characteristics help to compese one of those intensely real¬ <br id="r3l47">
            
            üigures we onlv mect with now and then ir, the Theatre. As impersonated <br id="r3l48">
            
            gesterdar by Miss Margaret Halstan, it was simply exquisite—a little more <br id="r3l49">
            
            appealing perhaps in the less exacting scenes than in the denouement, wiien <br id="r3l50">
            
            theactress’s tragic powers were putto the severest test, and now and thenan <br id="r3l51">
            
            inflection ofthe voice secmnedto fall a little short of the note that was wanted, <br id="r3l52">
            
            but always beautiful, wistful, and inevitably stricken by Fate. Such love¬, <br id="r3l53">
            
            stories as that of Christine and her Fritz are nearly always trägic. Perhaps <br id="r3l54">
            
            that is why most of cur dramatists —who feel that thev have to consider the <br id="r3l55">
            
            box-ollice and public taste—only trifle with taem when they touch them¬ <br id="r3l56">
            
            at all. <br id="r3l57">
            
            Cultured, handsome, self-indulgent, the figurerof Fritz is less sym¬ <br id="r3l58">
            
            pathetie but not less astype: commoner in the German and Austrian <br id="r3l59">
            
            armies than in ours-a soldier with the temperament-of an artist. In the <br id="r3l60">
            
            first act we find him beginning to weary a little of therfears of his fashion¬ <br id="r3l61">
            
            able mistress (she is sure they are being watched). He also is becoming <br id="r3l62">
            
            nervous; beginning to desire a love that would be “a caressing restful¬ <br id="r3l63">
            
            ness, and not acontinual fear and anxiety. Andithen, when it is too late, <br id="r3l64">
            
            and the duel is arränged, heealises that perhäßs,such a love is readv for <br id="r3l65">

            A DARING CREarloN. <br id="r3l75">
            
            Christine's old father is more strictly speaking. a creation—he is <br id="r3l76">
            
            even a daring creation. We are almost afraid to describe him, <br id="r3l77">
            
            feeling that our sentences will do injustice to the delicacy with which he is <br id="r3l78">
            
            set forth by the author. He would see his daughterchappy, and, knowing <br id="r3l79">
            
            of her passion for the voung oflicer, he is not afraid of or aghast at the <br id="r3l80">
            
            particular sort of happiness that scems in store for her, even at the risk <br id="r3l81">
            
            of after-sorrow. He is a dreamer, an artist, something of a transcen¬ <br id="r3l82">
            
            dentalist; and quite the worst sort of person to bes, in charge of such a <br id="r3l83">
            
            daughter. Que can almost imagine him seeking to console her <br id="r3l84">

            prehensible. And there was the lighter side of the story, enacted by Mr. <br id="r3l89">
            
            Charles Maude as a gayer brother-officer of Fritz, and Miss Margaret <br id="r3l90">

            Herr Max Behrend, the whole thing was well stage-managed, and full of <br id="r3l94">
            
            little touches of Austrian life, the illusion crcated by the#actors was sus¬ <br id="r3l95">
            
            tained in all other respects, and the play made its full #mpression. We <br id="r3l96">
            
            are much indebted to the Afternoon Theatre for producing a play which <br id="r3l97">
            
            so conspicuously fulfils the first requisition in serious drama—that of being <br id="r3l98">
