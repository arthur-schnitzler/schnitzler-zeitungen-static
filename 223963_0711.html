            PROFESSOR BERNHARDI. <br id="r5l7">
            
            By Arthur Schnitzler. <br id="r5l8">
            
            This play, which has been removed <br id="r5l9">
            
            from the Embassy tothe Phoenix, is a <br id="r5l10">
            
            singular piece, to my mind, for Schnitzler <br id="r5l11">
            
            to have written; for he is known chiefly <br id="r5l12">
            
            as the author of cynical comedies, where¬ <br id="r5l13">
            
            as Professor Bernhardi“ is a Gals¬ <br id="r5l14">
            
            worthy work, almost a piece of propa¬ <br id="r5l15">
            
            ganda, naive, rather than cynical. But <br id="r5l16">
            
            Schnitzler, it seems, had several sides to <br id="r5l17">
            
            his authorship, and this is one of them. <br id="r5l18">
            
            The play, which is dully, translated, <br id="r5l19">
            
            describes a conflict between Jews and <br id="r5l20">
            
            Gentiles in a hospital in terms that are, I <br id="r5l21">
            
            think, trivial. Indeed, the statement <br id="r5l22">
            
            that this is a conflict between Jews and <br id="r5l23">
            
            Gentiles is almost a mis-statement, and it <br id="r5l24">
            
            would be more accurate to say that the <br id="r5l25">
            
            conflict is between orthodoxy and hetero¬ <br id="r5l26">
            
            doxy, between the doctor and the priest, <br id="r5l27">
            
            between science and religion. But how <br id="r5l28">
            
            stupidly the conflict is caused by Bern¬ <br id="r5l29">
            
            hardi, who is a humourless prig, how hard <br id="r5l30">
            
            he makes it for the Gentiles to be concilia¬ <br id="r5l31">
            
            tory. Bernhardi is director of a clinic <br id="r5l32">
            
            which lives on donations. Its success is, <br id="r5l33">
            
            therefore, largely dependent on the favour <br id="r5l34">
            
            of the charitable public. Among the <br id="r5l35">
            
            patients is a girl suffering from the effects <br id="r5l36">
            
            of abortion. This girl, unaware of her <br id="r5l37">
            
            A <br id="r5l38">
            
            danger, is on the point of death. <br id="r5l39">
            
            priest appears and, on learning that death <br id="r5l40">
            
            is imminent, attempts to enter the ward <br id="r5l41">
            
            to give the girl the last rites of her <br id="r5l42">
            
            Church, but Bernhardi forbids him to do <br id="r5l43">
            
            so on the ground that it is his duty to <br id="r5l44">
            
            make his patient’s last hour happy. She <br id="r5l45">
            
            must not be made miserable by the un¬ <br id="r5l46">
            
            expected announcement that she will <br id="r5l47">
            
            probably be dead in a few minutes. <br id="r5l48">
            
            find myself unable to sympathise with <br id="r5l49">
            
            Bernhardi’s point of view, which is sloppy <br id="r5l50">
            
            in the extreme, and might very reason¬ <br id="r5l51">
            
            ably be resented by the patient whose <br id="r5l52">
            
            The <br id="r5l53">
            
            happiness he presumes to secure. <br id="r5l54">
            
            girl was a Catholic, and as such would <br id="r5l55">
            
            have preferred to die having received# <br id="r5l56">
            
            Extreme Unction than to die without it. <br id="r5l57">
            
            Bernhardi took an unpardonable liberty in <br id="r5l58">
            
            preventing her priest from having access <br id="r5l59">
            
            to her, a fact which does not appear to <br id="r5l60">
            
            have presented itself to Schnitzler’s mind. <br id="r5l61">
            
            Bernhardi’s disbelief in the virtue of <br id="r5l62">
            
            Extreme Unction is immaterial, and only <br id="r5l63">
            
            afanatic without vestige of common sense <br id="r5l64">
            
            would have acted as he did, involving his <br id="r5l65">
            
            Telinic in danger of dissolution. One’s feel¬ <br id="r5l66">
            
            ing that he behaves like an impertinent <br id="r5l67">
            
            fool robs the rest of the play of some of <br id="r5l68">
            
            its vitality. There need not have been <br id="r5l69">
            
            any of this trouble if Bernhardi had not <br id="r5l70">
            
            been a humourless prig, a wilful ass, an <br id="r5l71">
            
            imposer of his opinions on other people. <br id="r5l72">
            
            Nevertheless, the play is immensely inter¬ <br id="r5l73">
