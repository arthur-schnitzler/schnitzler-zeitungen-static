            Willi did not have that much; but his sense <br id="r1l14">
            
            of honor in these matters told him that the <br id="r1l15">

            disgraced and cashiered if the money were <br id="r1l17">

            what money he had in a card game and if <br id="r1l19">

            rich. He could buy new capes and sword <br id="r1l24">

            much money in speculation and investments; <br id="r1l80">
            
            Schnitzler has here related the story of a <br id="r1l81">
            
            but she permitted him to see her only on <br id="r1l82">
            
            rare occasions and gave him not a penny <br id="r1l83">
            
            before his allowance was due. <br id="r1l84">
            
            Willi found out the address of his aunt <br id="r1l85">
            
            and called upon her. He discovered that <br id="r1l86">
            
            she had formerly been one of his lights-o’¬ <br id="r1l87">
            
            love, one whom he had treated rather <br id="r1l88">
            
            shabbily. He made up to her and impressed <br id="r1l89">
            
            upon her the urgency of his need for money, <br id="r1l90">
            
            while at the same time playing the ardent <br id="r1l91">
            
            lover. They spent a night together and <br id="r1l92">
            
            when he believed that she was going to <br id="r1l93">
            
            advance him the money she left him a <br id="r1l94">
            
            thousand gulden note instead, in payment <br id="r1l95">
            
            for their night of love — a bit of mockery <br id="r1l96">
            
            at the small sum he had left for her when <br id="r1l97">
            
            they had last spent a night together — a <br id="r1l98">
            
            gesture she had loathed at that time because <br id="r1l99">
            
            she was in love with him. <br id="r1l100">
            
            The thousand was of no use to Willi; but <br id="r1l101">
            
            much ado about their honor; for it is very <br id="r2l1">
            
            apt to be a weak, vain, and not very ad¬ <br id="r2l2">
            
            mirable one, permitting them a free con¬ <br id="r2l3">
            
            science to act discreditanty in most of those <br id="r2l4">
            
            relations with human beings which call for <br id="r2l5">
            
            fairness and simple justice, kindness and <br id="r2l6">
            
            common honesty. <br id="r2l7">
            
            That, I believe, was the point Schnitzler <br id="r2l8">
            
            was getting at in this ironic novelette. <br id="r2l9">
            
            There was nothing very tragic in Willi’s <br id="r2l10">
            
            suicide; for his life had no real significance <br id="r2l11">
            
            and his character was not worth preserving. <br id="r2l12">
            
            Even in death he was not ennobled. And <br id="r2l13">
            
            that is the final irony. <br id="r2l14">
