            There was the spice of variety in last night’s <br id="r3l36">
            
            entertainment—a quintuple bill. We commenced <br id="r3l37">
            
            witha“hors d’ouvre' of economics, followed it <br id="r3l38">
            
            up with a neat little sermon on the superfluons <br id="r3l39">

            Rhine wine, sustained a lecture on the ethics of <br id="r3l41">
            
            automobilism, and“ topped off“ with Mr. <br id="r3l42">
