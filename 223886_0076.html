            URED EASTMAN pioneered when he went to the Chicago <br id="r3l12">
            
            1 Theological Seminary to take the Department of Religious <br id="r3l13">
            
            Drama. The writer is of the opinion that up to that time <br id="r3l14">
            
            only one or two educational institutions had ever given credit <br id="r3l15">
            
            in their graduate departments for the study of drama as an <br id="r3l16">
            
            aid to and an expression of religion. Now that the idea is <br id="r3l17">
            
            proving its worth, many schools and seminaries are beginning <br id="r3l18">
            
            to offer courses of this genera. nature. <br id="r3l19">
            
            Eastman pioneered also in writing a new definition of re¬ <br id="r3l20">
            
            ligious drama. It is, he says, not Biblical drama, nor mis¬ <br id="r3l21">
            
            sionary drama, nor dramatized Bible stories, nor church prop¬ <br id="r3l22">
            
            aganda thinly veiled. Rather, it is any form of drama which <br id="r3l23">
            
            has a religious effect upon players and audience. To those <br id="r3l24">
            
            who have grown disgusted with the weak and trashy plays and <br id="r3l25">
            
            pageants which have been built up out of stereotyped religious <br id="r3l26">
            
            forms in the immediate past, this new definition will come as <br id="r3l27">
            
            a breath of fresh air. It is symptomatic of the wider angles <br id="r3l28">
            
            in today’s religion that Professor Eastman should find high <br id="r3l29">
            
            religious values in drama which—like the Book of Esther—may <br id="r3l30">
            
            not even mention the name of God, but which deal power¬ <br id="r3l31">
            
            fully with the hopes and fearsof His people. <br id="r3l32">
            
            And now Eastman pioneers again in assembling a group of <br id="r3l33">
            
            plays which are easy to act, easy to produce, definitely religious <br id="r3l34">
            
            in their effect, and withal true to the finest traditions of play¬ <br id="r3l35">
            
            making. There is not a poor or weak play in the collection. <br id="r3l36">
