            that during the long period since he had last <br id="r1l18">

            young harlot and, having turned his wealth <br id="r1l21">
            
            over to her, had from her only a small <br id="r1l22">
            
            allowance. The wife had shown business <br id="r1l23">
            
            ing <br id="r1l24">
            
            enterprise and foresight, and had made <br id="r1l25">
            
            much money in speculation and investments; <br id="r1l26">
            
            f a, but she permitted him to see her only on <br id="r1l27">
            
            rare occasions and gave him not a penny <br id="r1l28">
            
            before his allowance was due. <br id="r1l29">
            
            Willi found out the address of his aunt <br id="r1l30">
            
            and called upon her. He discovered that <br id="r1l31">
            
            she had formerly been one of his lights-o’¬ <br id="r1l32">
            
            love, one whom he had treated rather <br id="r1l33">
            
            shabbily. He made upto her and impressed <br id="r1l34">
            
            upon her theurgency of his need fo. money, <br id="r1l35">
            
            while at the name time playing the ardent <br id="r1l36">
            
            lover. They spent a night together and <br id="r1l37">
            
            when he believed that she was going to <br id="r1l38">
            
            advance him the money she left him a <br id="r1l39">
            
            thousand gulden note instead, in payment <br id="r1l40">
            
            for their niglit of love — a bit of mockery <br id="r1l41">
            
            at the small sum he had left for her when <br id="r1l42">
            
            they had last spent a night together — a <br id="r1l43">
            
            gesture she had loathed at that time because <br id="r1l44">
            
            she was in love with him. <br id="r1l45">
            
            The thousand was of no use to Willi; but <br id="r1l46">
            
            he kept it and sent it to von Bogner. Then <br id="r1l47">
            
            he put a bullet through his head. The <br id="r1l48">
            
            uncle, having meanwhile prevailed upon his <br id="r1l49">
            
            wife to advance him the eleven thousand <br id="r1l50">
            
            gulden Willi needed te save his honor, <br id="r1l51">
            
            arrived just too late. <br id="r1l52">
            
            *One always remained an officer, no <br id="r1l53">
            
            matter what one did — or at any rate, one <br id="r1l54">
            
            became an officer again when one had paid <br id="r1l55">
            
            one’s gambling debts.“ <br id="r1l56">
            
            In other words a man of honor was still <br id="r1l57">
            
            a man of honor if he blew out his brains <br id="r1l58">
            
            rather than be reported to his commanding <br id="r1l59">
            
            officer for failure to pay a gambling debt <br id="r1l60">
            
            when it was due. If he observed that fine <br id="r1l61">
            
            point of the code, he might act the part of <br id="r1l62">
            
            the swine in every other particnlar. He <br id="r1l63">
            
            might play for stakes higher than le could <br id="r1l64">
            
            afford; he might insult one of the players <br id="r1l65">
            
            under the aszumption that that player was <br id="r1l66">
            
            not his social equal and could not therefore <br id="r1l67">
            
            challenge him to a duel; and he could de¬ <br id="r1l68">
            
            ceive his uncle with Fis uncle’s wife, not for <br id="r1l69">
            
            pleasure but meretriciously, by pretending <br id="r1l70">
            
            a sentiment he did not feel and asking her <br id="r1l71">
            
            for money which he could never repay. <br id="r1l72">
            
            Isaid at the beginning of this review that <br id="r1l73">
            
            Daybreak“ carried a moral lesson. But <br id="r1l74">
            
            it is not the conventional and obvious one, <br id="r1l75">
            
            that gambling is a vice or that the wages of <br id="r1l76">
            
            sin is death. We should be taught by this <br id="r1l77">
            
            little story to examine the central factor in <br id="r1l78">

            apt to be a weak, vain, and not very ad¬ <br id="r2l4">
            
            mirable one, permitting them a free con¬ <br id="r2l5">
            
            science to act discreditably in most of those <br id="r2l6">

            fairness and simple justice, kindness and <br id="r2l8">
            
            common honesty. <br id="r2l9">
            
            That, I believe, was the point Schnitzler <br id="r2l10">
            
            was getting at in this ironic novelette. <br id="r2l11">
            
            There was nothing very tragic in Willi's <br id="r2l12">
            
            suicide; for his life had no real significance <br id="r2l13">
            
            and his character was not worth preserving. <br id="r2l14">
            
            Even in death he was not ennobled. And <br id="r2l15">
            
            that is the final irony. <br id="r2l16">
