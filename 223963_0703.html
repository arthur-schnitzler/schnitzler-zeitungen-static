            soie of the season’s finest acting. <br id="r2l20">
            
            Professor Bernhardi is a Jewish doctor, <br id="r2l21">
            
            head of a large private hospital in Austria. <br id="r2l22">
            
            He refuses to let a Catholic priest admini¬ <br id="r2l23">
            
            ster the last sacrament to a dying girl, since <br id="r2l24">
            
            the girl is blissfully ignorant of the fact <br id="r2l25">
            
            that death is rapidly approaching. <br id="r2l26">
            
            Because Bernhardi is a Jew, the incident <br id="r2l27">
            
            is cagerly seized on by jealous fellow <br id="r2l28">
            
            doctors, is perverted out of all semblance <br id="r2l29">
            
            to the truth, and Bernhardi is finally sent <br id="r2l30">
            
            to prison. <br id="r2l31">
            
            The topicality of the theme alone invests <br id="r2l32">
            
            ithe play with importance. <br id="r2l33">
            
            But such is the character of the acting, <br id="r2l34">
            
            that you are conscious only of the human <br id="r2l35">
            
            drama that is unfolding before you. It is <br id="r2l36">
            
            not until later that the broader aspects of <br id="r2l37">
            
            ithe conflict strike home. <br id="r2l38">
            
            As the Jewish doctor, Abraham Sofaer <br id="r2l39">
            
            plays with restraint and suppleness, with <br id="r2l40">
            
            not a single false note throughout his long <br id="r2l41">
