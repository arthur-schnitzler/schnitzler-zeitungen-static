            THAT Schnitzier'’s highly interesting play,“ The Call of Life“ <br id="r1l14">
            
            (Comedy Theater), is one of its author’s,earlier efforts is <br id="r1l15">
            
            revealed by something more than that unnatural heightening of <br id="r1l16">
            
            its colors which betrays the exuberance of an undisciplined <br id="r1l17">
            
            imagination. Its very theme—the brevity of life and the sin of <br id="r1l18">
            
            wasting one of its fleeting moments—is a theme which youth <br id="r1l19">
            
            would choose, for it is not toward the end, when ardor has cooled <br id="r1l20">
            
            and experience has taught how many promises go unfulfilled, <br id="r1l21">
            
            that life seems most precious but rather at the beginning when <br id="r1l22">
            
            every knock at the door seems to herald some unknown and de¬ <br id="r1l23">
            
            lightful visitor. Thus it is that death seems closest to those <br id="r1l24">
            
            from whom it is in reality farthest away, and thus that old men <br id="r1l25">
            
            with only a year or two to live contentedly doze the months <br id="r1l26">
            
            away while youths agoni over a summer lost as though there <br id="r1l27">
            
            were not countless sumers yet to come. The Schnitzler who <br id="r1l28">
            
            wrote“ The Call of Life' had not yet arrived at the conviction, <br id="r1l29">
            
            so plainly expressed in later plays, that existence is a game <br id="r1l30">
            
            played against an antagonist who always wins and whose name <br id="r1l31">
            
            is Boredom; rather was he one who did not as yet know life <br id="r1l32">
            
            well encugh to picture it in a manner wholly convincing but who, <br id="r1l33">
            
            perhaps because of that imperfect knowledge, was able to ex¬ <br id="r1l34">
            
            press his passionate conviction that the bitterest of all thoughts <br id="r1l35">
            
            is the thought that one may be deprived of the opportunity of <br id="r1l36">
            
            knowing it. The sentence, uttered by one in the grip of such a <br id="r1l37">
            
            fear, which gives the key to the emotion of the piece is this: <br id="r1l38">
            
            *Only those who have much to remember lie quietly in their <br id="r1l39">
            
            graves'; and it is plainly the utterance of a man who possessed <br id="r1l40">
            
            the two qualities which make life seem most precious. He was <br id="r1l41">
            
            young and he was an artist. <br id="r1l42">
            
            The first act of the play is by far the best because it is the# <br id="r1l43">
            
            simplest and rhe most clear cut. With a sense of reality never <br id="r1l44">
            
            recaptured during the succeeding two acts it presents the pie¬ <br id="r1l45">
            
            ture of a young girl chained to the bedside of a slowly dying <br id="r1l46">
            
            father and struggling between the artificial sense of duty to her <br id="r1l47">
            
            parent and the natural sense of her right to life. Without, the <br id="r1l48">
            
            noise of the passing throng summons her to a participation in <br id="r1l49">
            
            the experiences which seem in imagination so unutterably im¬ <br id="r1l50">
            
            portant; within, the old man, intuitively conscious of her strug¬ <br id="r1l51">
            
            gle, suggests with the logic of age that many years will remain <br id="r1l52">
            
            after he is dead; but to her it seems that if this one night <br id="r1l53">
            
            and the lover who awaits her is missed all life will be missed. <br id="r1l54">
            
            and the author who understands the father with his head but <br id="r1l55">
            
            understands her with his heart sends her to her adventure and <br id="r1l56">
            
            her lover. From then on, it must be confessed, the play grows <br id="r1l57">
            
            steadily less convincing as a picture of real life; the theme <br id="r1l58">
            
            pursued through various intricacies and reintroduced in new <br id="r1l59">
            
            surroundings becomes less and less sharply defined, and the <br id="r1l60">
            
            #ineidents grow more and more tncatrical. Tet, withal, tho <br id="r1l61">
            
            theatricalism is of a not wholly unpleasant kind, for it is not <br id="r1l62">
            
            the result of insincerity and trickery but of a genuine feeling <br id="r1l63">
            
            which cannot quite adequately express itself; and thus, though <br id="r1l64">
            
            verisimilitude sometimes fails, the genuineness of the emotion is <br id="r1l65">
            
            alwags clearly and interestingly evident. <br id="r1l66">
            
            The author has nowhe.e actually thought his way through, <br id="r1l67">
            
            and his sincerity is not of a predominantly intellectual sort. <br id="r1l68">
            
            Because his conviction that the call of life is higher than the <br id="r1l69">
            
            call of duty is not the reasoned conclusion of a Nietzschean <br id="r1l70">
