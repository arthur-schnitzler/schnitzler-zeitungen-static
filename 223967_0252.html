            less tarred with tho aame brush; they are entirely <br id="r1l3">
            
            unmoral and frankir bonstful of the fact. One might <br id="r1l4">
            
            speak of them as degencrates, were it not that they <br id="r1l5">
            
            take such a healthy pride in their own misdoings. <br id="r1l6">
            
            You havo, for instance, Prince Ravenstein, who has <br id="r1l7">
            
            seduced the daughter of his friend, Count Pazmandy, <br id="r1l8">
            
            the Countess Mizzi. The result oftheir intrigue is a <br id="r1l9">
            
            son. Philip whom his mother has not even cared to <br id="r1l10">
            
            recoguse, and who, although little more than a youth, <br id="r1l11">
            
            has developed tastes very much on a par with those <br id="r1l12">
            
            indulged in by his father. Count Pazmandy is him¬ <br id="r1l13">
            
            self a viveur of the first order. For many years he <br id="r1l14">
            
            has lived on a basis of intimacy with a notorious <br id="r1l15">
            
            dancer called Lolo, who in the end calmly throws <br id="r1l16">
            
            him over in order to marry a well-to-do livery-stable <br id="r1l17">
            
            proprietor. <br id="r1l18">
            
            The play is littie more than a serics of conversa¬ <br id="r1l19">
            
            tions, carried on with a most perfect and unblushing <br id="r1l20">
            
            candour by these and other charcters, and would <br id="r1l21">
            
            be intolerable werc it handled in a less witty fashion. <br id="r1l22">
            
            When the serions things of life are presented in so <br id="r1l23">

            thing of their importance, and Schnitzler plays the <br id="r1l25">
            
            Jester so airily that he well-nigh tempts us to forget <br id="r1l26">
            
            the gravitv of the cnormities he unmasks. It is, <br id="r1l27">
            
            of course, essential to the well-being of such a piece, <br id="r1l28">
            
            that theoriginal atmosphereand surroundings should <br id="r1l29">
            
            bepreserved. Norcanitbeexpected that Englishartists <br id="r1l30">
            
            Ishould quite succeed in giving the requisite form <br id="r1l31">
            
            and substance to ideas so entirely beyond their ken. <br id="r1l32">
            
            Mr. Athol Stowart, nevertheless, is to be congratu¬ <br id="r1l33">
            
            lated on his clever rendering of the part of Princo <br id="r1l34">

            THE GREEN COCKATOO.“ <br id="r1l41">
            
            The Green Cockatoo is a work of very diffe¬ <br id="r1l42">
            
            rent fibre. It is hardly an exaggeration to describe <br id="r1l43">
            
            it as a masterpiece of its kind. The elements of <br id="r1l44">
            
            humour, observation, dramatic effect, and sensation¬ <br id="r1l45">
            
            alism are blended in it with the happiest results. <br id="r1l46">
            
            At one moment you are thrilled to the marrow; an <br id="r1l47">
            
            instant later responsive laughter greets the grotesque¬ <br id="r1l48">
            
            ness of the situation. It is the period of the Terror <br id="r1l49">
            
            in Paris. To the Green Cockatoo, an undergwund <br id="r1l50">
            
            tavern kept by Prosper, formerly a theatrical <br id="r1l51">
            
            manager, aristocrats are flocking to enjoy a new <br id="r1l52">
            
            experience. Prosper has engaged a company of <br id="r1l53">
            
            needy actors and actresses. Their business is to <br id="r1l54">
            
            relate to his wealthy but dissolute clientele incidents <br id="r1l55">
            
            which may or may not have occurred. The place, <br id="r1l56">
            
            for cxample, is suddenly invaded by a weird figure, <br id="r1l57">
            
            wilo tells with intense realism how he is flying from <br id="r1l58">
            
            justice because ho has taken his rival's life; à man <br id="r1l59">
            
            seizes his wife by the throat and endeavours to <br id="r1l60">
            
            strangle her because she has been unfaithful. The <br id="r1l61">
            
            situation ends in a laugh or a taunt by the host that <br id="r1l62">
            
            it is not a bit like the real thing. <br id="r1l63">
            
            That comes later in an episode which stirs the <br id="r1l64">
            
            Tandience both on the stage and in front of the cur¬ <br id="r1l65">
            
            toin to a manifestation of unusual excitement. <br id="r1l66">
            
            Henri, a young actor, has just married Loocadie, an <br id="r1l67">
            
            aetress, whose reputation is admittedly not of thef <br id="r1l68">
            
            best. To that, however, he is fairly indifferent. <br id="r1l69">
            
            The two take their departure from the Cabaret. A <br id="r1l70">
            
            quarter of an hour later Henri reappears. He is <br id="r1l71">
            
            evidently a prey to profound emotion. With a <br id="r1l72">
            
            wealth of gesture and in broken accents he relates <br id="r1l73">
            
            how he had surprised his wife with the Duc de <br id="r1l74">
            
            Cadignan in a situation which left no doubt as to <br id="r1l75">
            
            their guilt. Just then a turbulent crow, surges <br id="r1l76">
            
            in with the news that the Bastille has been taken, <br id="r1l77">
            
            that the people are triumphant. Momentarily we <br id="r1l78">
            
            are led to imagine that the wholo affair has veen <br id="r1l79">
            
            clevorly stage-managed by Prosper. But the fruch <br id="r1l80">
            
            is quickly out. Henri, meanwhile, has succceded <br id="r1l81">
            
            by his acting in deceiving even his friends, ahr <br id="r1l82">
            
            crowd round congratulating him on having dis¬ <br id="r1l83">
            
            covcred Lcocadie’s perfidy, which has been knowa <br id="r1l84">
            
            to them for long. The statement falls like a thunder¬ <br id="r1l85">
            
            # <br id="r1l86">
            
            bolt upon him. Just then tho Duc enters. The <br id="r1l87">
            
            infuriated Henri springs upon him and plunges a <br id="r1l88">
            
            dagger into his hoart. The comedy is finished, and <br id="r1l89">
            
            the curtain falls. <br id="r1l90">
            
            In all this there is just a suspicion of theatricality. <br id="r1l91">
            
            But the story swings along at such a paco and the <br id="r1l92">
            
            characterisation is so varied and excellent that <br id="r1l93">
            
            nothing else is heeded. Mr. Leon Quartermaine did <br id="r1l94">
            
            splendid work as Henri, while Mr. Luke Forster as <br id="r1l95">
            
            Frosper, Mr. Norr ian Page as a youthful ruffian, <br id="r1l96">
            
            diss Caroline Bayley as Leocadie, and their numo¬ <br id="r1l97">
            
            rous companions carried the piece to immediate <br id="r1l98">
            
            success. A word also should be spared to Mr. Norman <br id="r1l99">
            
            Page for his extremely effective production of thel <br id="r1l100">
