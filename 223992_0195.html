            Liebelet is an Austrian, and his present work has <br id="r3l33">
            
            already been produced successfully at Vienna, where <br id="r3l34">
            
            the scene is laid. Liebelet may be translated as“ love¬ <br id="r3l35">
            
            making; each act is complete in itself, containing <br id="r3l36">
            
            some very admirable character sketches and finely <br id="r3l37">
            
            constructed scenes. There is but little plot, the prin¬ <br id="r3l38">
            
            cipal attractions of the piece being the elegant simplicity <br id="r3l39">
            
            gof its language and the delicate shading of the cha¬ <br id="r3l40">
            
            Tracters, which are very life-like. <br id="r3l41">
            
            The first act is laid in the dwelling of Fritz Lobhei¬ <br id="r3l42">
            
            mer, a young man of fashion. In the opening scene he <br id="r3l43">
            
            is treated to a homily from his friend Theodor, who is <br id="r3l44">
            
            expounding his views upon the science of love-making. <br id="r3l45">
            
            Love should not be treated as a grand passion, he says, <br id="r3l46">
            
            for it is then exciting, injurious, even deadly; love for <br id="r3l47">
            
            a young man should be a recreation pure and simple; <br id="r3l48">
            
            above all, a liaison with a married woman should ber <br id="r3l49">
            
            avoided, a sensible man permitting himself only flirta¬ <br id="r3l50">
            
            tions with young girls who demanded nothing moren <br id="r3l51">
            
            than he chose to give. Theodor selects his words witht# <br id="r3l52">
            
            direct intention, for his friend is deeply entangled in a <br id="r3l53">
            
            love affair with a married woman who loves him pas¬ <br id="r3l54">
            
            sionately—too passionately, and he is beginning to <br id="r3l55">
            
            writhe under the chains with which he has bound him¬ <br id="r3l56">
            
            self. Theodor has invited to an improvised aupper hist <br id="r3l57">
            
            ##friend' Mizi, a vivacious young person from a mil¬ <br id="r3l58">
            
            linery establishment, and her friend Christine, a gentle, <br id="r3l59">
            
            rather sentimental girl of virtuous character, who has <br id="r3l60">
            
            expended the best she has to give upon Lobheimer. <br id="r3l61">
            
            Thetwo girls presently arrive in Fritz’s rooms—Mizi: <br id="r3l62">
            
            the personification of animal spirits and “cheeky ? <br id="r3l63">
            
            good-comradeship, in the gavest of costumes; Christine: <br id="r3l64">
            
            shy but loving, her beauty being set off by a simple <br id="r3l65">
            
            dress. The ladies arrange the supper-table thei <br id="r3l66">
            
            men providing the eatables and wines, and soon <br id="r3l67">
            
            all is joy and convivality. After supper al <br id="r3l68">
            
            little freedom in the matter of kisses is per¬ <br id="r3l69">
            
            mitted, and Fritz sits down to play a waltz for. <br id="r3l70">
            
            Mizi and her friend, Christine bending over the piano¬ <br id="r3l71">
            
            with no eyes butfor him. She tells him under cover off <br id="r3l72">
            
            the soft music what he is to her, how his love for her <br id="r3l73">
            
            has beautified her life; and Lobheimer almost feels as <br id="r3l74">
            
            if he loves her indeed, so soothing is her gentle, tender¬ <br id="r3l75">
            
            nature after the wild passion of the riper woman. <br id="r3l76">
            
            Suddenly the gay company are interrupted by thei <br id="r3l77">
            
            ringing of the door beil; Lobheimer, looking from thei <br id="r3l78">
            
            window, recognises the husband he has wronged. <br id="r3l79">
            
            Hurriedly acquainting his friends with thefact he sends <br id="r3l80">
            
            them all into another room, and admits his late visitor. <br id="r3l81">
            
            Ashort scene pregnant with meaning follows; the men <br id="r3l82">
            
            exchange but few sentences; the husband has found <br id="r3l83">
            
            Lobheimer’s letters—which he brings him—in his wife's <br id="r3l84">
            
            possession and is aware of bis dishonour. He does not <br id="r3l85">
            
            wish the letters to be found“ afterwards, he says, and <br id="r3l86">
            
            Fritz understands, and places Fimself at the disposal of <br id="r3l87">
            
            the man he has betrayed. The ducl will take place in <br id="r3l88">
            
            two days; and the interview ends with the repression <br id="r3l89">
            
            of feeling with which it commenced. Lobheimer recalls <br id="r3l90">
            
            his friends and endeavours to act as if nothing had hap¬ <br id="r3l91">
            
            pened, but his wonted spirits will not come at his <br id="r3l92">
            
            „ <br id="r3l93">
            
            bidding, and the company soon disperse. Theodor, <br id="r3l94">
            
            being requested by his friend to return, does so, and <br id="r3l95">
            
            reluctantly undertakes the oflice of second. <br id="r3l96">
            
            The second act shows us Christine’s home, and intro¬ <br id="r3l97">
            
            duces her father—first violin at one of thetheatres. Old <br id="r3l98">
            
            Weiring is a character in his way, and a philosopher; <br id="r3l99">
            
            he contends that the only things worth having in later <br id="r3l100">
            
            life are the“remembances,'and would rather his child <br id="r3l101">
            
            should love under any conditions than that she should <br id="r3l102">
            
            have no sweet memories in her old age. So he is later <br id="r3l103">
            
            on neither surprised nor grieved at Christinc’s love for <br id="r3l104">
            
            Lobheimer, and calmly receives all the insinuations of <br id="r3l105">
            
            a mischief-making neighbour, who tries to calumniate <br id="r3l106">
            
            his daughter. Christine herself watches all day forher <br id="r3l107">
            
            lover, who has promised to come; she is alternately <br id="r3l108">
            
            hopeful and despairing, for it is late in the evening <br id="r3l109">
            
            when he arrives. He tells her he will be absent for a <br id="r3l110">
            
            time—that he is going a journey, and in the moment of <br id="r3l111">
            
            farewell, with a prevision of his end upon him, he really <br id="r3l112">
            
            loves the girl who has given him her life. He promises <br id="r3l113">
            
            to write to her and then, with a heavy heart, goes. <br id="r3l114">
            
            The third act contains some painfully impressive <br id="r3l115">
            
            scenes: Christine waits and watches in vain for some <br id="r3l116">
