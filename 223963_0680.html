            Abraham Sofaer, gave a memorable perforinance, Indeed, apart from <br id="r1l41">

            difficult to fathom the cause for this anomalous state of affairs. As a <br id="r1l46">
            
            very frequent visitor to the theatre I have noticed that Jews aro <br id="r1l47">
