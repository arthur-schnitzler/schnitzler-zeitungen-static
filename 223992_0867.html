            This play, which, as we understand, is very success¬ <br id="r3l22">
            
            ful in Austria and Germany, has a simple story. <br id="r3l23">
            
            Fritz Lobheimer, an offlcer in an Austrian Dragoon <br id="r3l24">
            
            regiment, has been carrying on an intrigue with a <br id="r3l25">
            
            married woman, and another at the same tirne with <br id="r3l26">
            
            Christine, the daughter of old Hans Weiring, a <br id="r3l27">
            
            violinist in a theatre orchestra, The husband of <br id="r3l28">
            
            the married woman challenges him and kills him; <br id="r3l29">
            
            and Christine, on learning the news, rushes out in <br id="r3l30">
            
            despair, to commit, as we are led to believe, suiclde. <br id="r3l31">
            
            That is the skeleton—simple, and strong enough to <br id="r3l32">
            
            bear a body of genuine tragedy. Towards clothing <br id="r3l33">
            
            it with gennine tragedy the author has gone a good <br id="r3l34">
            
            way. We learn very early in the play that Christine <br id="r3l35">
            
            is not like her friend Mizi Schlager, a mere light¬ <br id="r3l36">
            
            o’-love, despising all men, but equally rendy to take <br id="r3l37">
            
            any lover she can get and to bid him a cheerful <br id="r3l38">
            
            good-bye when she can kcep him no longer. Christine <br id="r3l39">
            
            takes the affair very seriously. She has in her a pretty <br id="r3l40">
            
            strong dose of the will to keep. Fritz is her first <br id="r3l41">
            
            lover—for hitherto she has been quite respectable— <br id="r3l42">
            
            and he will be her last. Fritz looks at the matter <br id="r3l43">
            
            in atotally different light. Even at t#e merry supper¬ <br id="r3l44">
            
            party in the first act his bead is at least as full of <br id="r3l45">
            
            the married woman as of Christine. And after that <br id="r3l46">
            
            party (Fritz is entertaining his friend Theodor Kaiser <br id="r3l47">
            
            and Theodor’s“ friend Mizi, and Christine, and they <br id="r3l48">
            
            have been drinking Bruderschaff and doing all sorts <br id="r3l49">
            
            of amusing Austrian things) has been interrupted by <br id="r3l50">
            
            the enraged husband with his challenge, he has, of <br id="r3l51">
            
            course, an additional reason for insisting to Christine <br id="r3l52">
            
            that this sort of thing is only temporary. It <br id="r3l53">
            
            is all no use. The will to keep in Christine is only# <br id="r3l54">
            
            intensified in the second act by Fritz’s very charming <br id="r3l55">
            
            way of saying what he knows, but Christine does not <br id="r3l56">
            
            know, to be probably a last farewell, vowing (what <br id="r3l57">
            
            was doubtless true at the moment) that he really did <br id="r3l58">
            
            love her. And so it happens that in the third act, <br id="r3l59">
            
            when the news is brought to the girl that her lover is <br id="r3l60">
            
            not only dead, but has been shot in a duel about <br id="r3l61">
            
            another woman, she is driven practically mad by her <br id="r3l62">
            
            loss. <br id="r3l63">
            
            Madness, it has been said, is only exaggerated <br id="r3l64">
            
            selfishness. It may be so; in any case the <br id="r3l65">
            
            madness—that is, the character—of Christine is just <br id="r3l66">
            
            what, in our opinion, has prevented this play from <br id="r3l67">
            
            becoming a genuine tragedy. It has affected it in <br id="r3l68">
            
            two ways. The first, and least important, is this <br id="r3l69">
            
            Christine has been, all along, a negative person. <br id="r3l70">
            
            She appeared te have only one positive quality— <br id="r3l71">
            
            that pretty strong dose of the will to keep. And so, <br id="r3l72">
            
            when this negative, inarticulate creature suddenly <br id="r3l73">
            
            breaks into eloquence and pours out, disjointedly <br id="r3l74">
            
            but with acute point, rage and scorn and grief, we <br id="r3l75">
            
            feel that this is not Christine herself speaking, but <br id="r3l76">
            
            the author. The girl herself—at any rate, as we saw <br id="r3l77">
            
            her yesterday—might feel these things dimly, but <br id="r3l78">
            
            she never could say them. It is the author who feels <br id="r3l79">
            
            them acutely for her, and uses her inappropriate <br id="r3l80">
            
            mouth forthe expression of them. A more important <br id="r3l81">
            
            matter is this, that we see in Christine no trace of <br id="r3l82">
            
            regret for the man who is dead. Not a single“ Poor <br id="r3l83">
