            Tho play takes the unusual form of four <br id="r3l3">
            
            short scenes. It began in the kitchen of a doss¬ <br id="r3l4">
            
            heuse, which Jim Harris managed for bis <br id="r3l5">

            and penniless, to be subsequently pursued by <br id="r3l7">
            
            her drunken and foul-mouthed husband Bill. <br id="r3l8">
            
            Bill was a boon companion of Jim Harris, but <br id="r3l9">
            
            Jim proposed to hide the wife and pack the <br id="r3l10">
            
            Thusband off. Wewere neverquite at home with <br id="r3l11">
            
            Jim. From tho first ho seemed a kind of hero <br id="r3l12">
            
            whom you would not find managing just any <br id="r3l13">

            the house and kept the fuming Bill behind <br id="r3l17">
            
            long enough for her to escape. <br id="r3l18">
            
            BETWEEN TWO STOOLS. <br id="r3l19">
            
            In the next scene, midnight having fallen <br id="r3l20">
            
            upon the dosshouse, Liz Higgins crept back. <br id="r3l21">
            
            Sue was quite resoureeless, Jim liked her more <br id="r3l22">
            
            and more, gave her sixpence for a night's <br id="r3l23">
            
            lodging, and proposed te meet her in the morn¬ <br id="r3l24">
            
            #ing and set up house with her. She was not <br id="r3l25">
            
            exbilarated bythe prospect or his kisses. After <br id="r3l26">
            
            Fall, ehe was her Bill's lawful wife; she was <br id="r3l27">
            
            Tborn respectable, and in some fashion orrother <br id="r3l28">
            
            Ishe still loved the brutish rascal. So the third <br id="r3l29">
            
            scene took her buck to him. <br id="r3l30">
            
            There was no doubt about Mre. Higgins. <br id="r3l31">
            
            FShe was a real human ereature in all her vacil¬ <br id="r3l32">
            
            iations and ber helplessneen. Perhaps we did <br id="r3l33">
            
            Hot feel much kinduess for ber. She was by <br id="r3l34">
            
            nature so futile, such a blind waif in the <br id="r3l35">
            
            world. But there is notuble work in the <br id="r3l36">
            
            Scharacter, observation, and knnwledge austerely <br id="r3l37">
            
            Tree trom the temptations of sentiment. When <br id="r3l38">
            
            her Bill found her home again hewas rendy <br id="r3l39">
            
            to be moderately penitent. Unfortunately he <br id="r3l40">
            
            would talk abnnt Jim Harris and breathe <br id="r3l41">
            
            suspicions threats. In vain Liz prutested that <br id="r3l42">
            
            Jim was not, had not been, and never wonld <br id="r3l43">
            
            be anything to her. Bill growied still of <br id="r3l44">
            
            revenge, and when sbe protested raged at her, <br id="r3l45">
            
            Isc again she ran away. <br id="r3l46">
            
            Between twc stools, the poor greature fell <br id="r3l47">
            
            to the ground. Jim might perhaps have for¬ <br id="r3l48">
            
            givon her stealing back to Bill, might have for¬ <br id="r3l49">
            
            given her pathetie plending that she was <br id="r3l50">
            
            respestable. and did not know how to be any¬ <br id="r3l51">
            
            thing eise. He cuuld Lot forgive a lie, und <br id="r3l52">
            
            she had told Bill that Jim and she had noth.ug <br id="r3l53">
            
            between them. Jim was disgusted at that, <br id="r3l54">
            
            and did not want her any more. A nice point <br id="r3l55">
            
            in male humar nature this. hut quite credible. <br id="r3l56">
            
            What was to become of her? Jim hud hi <br id="r3l57">
            
            solution. He began to langh in a queer way, <br id="r3l58">
            
            he asked her to kiss him. and be stabbed her. <br id="r3l59">
            
            Was he mad? We hau heurd something, but 5 <br id="r3l60">
            
            nothing conclusive, of his queerness. Was be“ <br id="r3l61">
            
            resolved, like some other peopie in literature, <br id="r3l62">
            
            to preserve the lady spotless for another world? <br id="r3l63">
            
            Was he merely determined, by the balance of <br id="r3l64">
            
            probaLility, that the most comfortable thing <br id="r3l65">
            
            Ifor her was death? After all, it ie in some sort <br id="r3l66">
            
            a compliment to the play that it should leave b. <br id="r3l67">
            
            us thinking its conclusion worth epoculation. <br id="r3l68">
            
            It was finelyacted. Mr. Norman MoKinnel, <br id="r3l69">

            Jim wholly comprehensible, gave us a wonderful <br id="r3l71">
            
            suggestion of rongh strength, and in the last <br id="r3l72">
            
            scene wus quite eerie. Miss May Blavney <br id="r3l73">
            
            played che hapless Liz with a most pathetig <br id="r3l74">

            there is no doubt abomt its thrill. There was <br id="r3l88">
            
            plenty of good individual work in the perform¬ <br id="r3l89">
