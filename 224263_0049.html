            HERMANN BROCH <br id="r1l7">
            
            Broch, however, had only to wait before acknowledging his work as his <br id="r1l8">
            
            own until it had become wholly imself; and having sprung from a source <br id="r1l9">
            
            of significance and greatness, it was itself significant and great. And since <br id="r1l10">
            
            he only writes when he has something of importance to say, and writing, <br id="r1l11">
            
            apparently, does not come easily to him, and it is therefore all the more <br id="r1l12">
            
            necessarv for him to wait for an adequate fruitful stimulus, his next <br id="r1l13">
            
            book“ Die unbekannte Grösse? (“ The Unknown Quantity?’) did not <br id="r1l14">
            
            appear until three years later. To this we may add a number of essays, <br id="r1l15">
            
            most of which appeared in the“ Neue Rundschau, — Das Böse im <br id="r1l16">
            
            Wertsystem der Kunst’ (“ Evil in the System of Art Valucs?' or“ The <br id="r1l17">
            
            Artistic Value of Evil'’), essavs which represent, as we shall see later, <br id="r1l18">
            
            an important aspect of his work; further, a paper on James Joyce, which <br id="r1l19">
            
            is only now being published, lyrical poetry and a play," Die Entsühnung <br id="r1l20">
            
            (“ The Atonement*'). <br id="r1l21">
            
            Everything that Broch writes serves a definite purpose: no mere <br id="r1l22">
            
            handicraft or seasonal work. When he writes, when he depicts our times <br id="r1l23">
            
            in his novels, poems, essays, plays, he does so to help us overcome them. <br id="r1l24">
            
            And in this he succeeds, because outward occurrences always signify <br id="r1l25">
            
            to him an inner meaning. <br id="r1l26">
            
            Die Schlafwaendler? (“ The Sleep-walkers*), Broch’s chief work <br id="r1l27">
            
            so far, is in the form of a trilogy. If we consider it as a whole, as forming <br id="r1l28">
            
            one structure, each ofthe three parts appears to open a new door that would <br id="r1l29">
            
            lead us to the heart of the world. Of the three books comprising the work, <br id="r1l30">
            
            the first:“ Pasenow or Romanticism?' is the most easily accessible. <br id="r1l31">
            
            This is because the contents of this book are still readily comprehensible, <br id="r1l32">
            
            and because the central idea of the work, for the sakeof which it was written, <br id="r1l33">
            
            is still kept well in the background. Only after becoming familiar with the <br id="r1l34">
            
            other volumes can we learn from this first volume also, that already in the <br id="r1l35">
            
            year 1888 (a date which is appended to the title ofthe novel) it was possible <br id="r1l36">
            
            to recognise that laws may become obsolete, and that coming changes <br id="r1l37">
            
            in the times may be deduced from the destruction of conventions based <br id="r1l38">
            
            on conceptions that appear indestructible. To give one example: a father, <br id="r1l39">
            
            who has grown up with strict ideas of honour and has brought up his <br id="r1l40">
            
            children in the same spirit, loses his eldest son in a duel. How the world <br id="r1l41">
            
            becomes without meaning for the old man, but how also the recognition <br id="r1l42">
            
            of the senselessness of a hitherto unquestioned dogma is a sign of the <br id="r1l43">
            
            passing of a world, is wonderfully brought out by this symbol. Of course, <br id="r1l44">
            
            „“ <br id="r1l45">
            
            this is not the only form of romanticism dealt with in“ Pasenow. <br id="r1l46">
            
            The new age, as depicted on the estate of the Pasenows, not onl y creates <br id="r1l47">
            
            for itself new conceptions of honour, but also casts its own lig ht on the <br id="r1l48">
            
            romanticism of love and human life. Though at the close of the first <br id="r1l49">
            
            volume the young Pasenow has shaken off his mistress and married the <br id="r1l50">
            
            girl who loved his friend but had been appointed for him, we cannot resist <br id="r1l51">
            
            the feeling that the time of the“ Eschs“, the time of“ Anarchy (1ooz) <br id="r1l52">
