            A STUDY IN ANTI-SEMITISM <br id="r2l19">
            
            Only a few weeks ago, this brilliaut classic of Schnitzler’s was <br id="r2l20">
            
            presented at the Embassy Theatre. It has now been put on in the <br id="r2l21">
            
            West End at the Phenix Theatre; and even seeing it again after <br id="r2l22">
            
            80 short an interval, the power and interest ofthe work grip one <br id="r2l23">
            
            afresh. <br id="r2l24">
            
            Apart fromthe intense interest which holds the attention from start <br id="r2l25">
            
            to finish—the brilliant dialogue and the valuable light which the play <br id="r2l26">
            
            throws upon the psychology of anti-Semitism —the very evenness with <br id="r2l27">
            
            which the anthor holds the seales in the case of the Trofessor, lends the <br id="r2l28">
            
            story a vivid reality and raises the discn-sion to a pläne of immediate <br id="r2l29">
            
            importance. What Schnitzier shows—and it is a depressing thought that <br id="r2l30">
            
            this is as evident to-day as it was when he wrote the play many <br id="r2l31">
            
            Fears before the War—is that the antipathy to the Jew in its“ <br id="r2l32">
            
            original primitive form, is only a <br id="r2l33">
            
            very little of the whole <br id="r2l34">
            
            trouble. It is the thousand and onc interests and occasions for <br id="r2l35">
            
            sellish opportunism which, building upon the brutish base of hate, raise <br id="r2l36">
            
            upthe hideous super-structure of anti-Semitism as a political or social or <br id="r2l37">
            
            superstitions erced. Again I must point out that this play in no way <br id="r2l38">
            
            attempts to portray the conflict between the Jewish and Christian attitude <br id="r2l39">
            
            on the purely religions plane. Schnitzler carefully shows us the priest <br id="r2l40">
            
            and the Jewish doctor respecting eachother as two honest men, separated <br id="r2l41">
            
            by differences of dogma, but both capable of contributing to the good of <br id="r2l42">
            
            mankind. It is the intrusion of the mean, the selfish, the billiously¬ <br id="r2l43">
            
            hating and dishonestly-jealons among men that produces the urge to <br id="r2l44">
            
            persecute the Jew, and raises an incident into a malicious generalisation. <br id="r2l45">
            
            It has been suggested by no less an authority on theatrical matters <br id="r2l46">
            
            than Mr. Sydney Carroll, writing on this great play, that, from bis <br id="r2l47">
            
            experienee, Christians as a rule are far more interested in plays of a <br id="r2l48">
            
            Jewish problem nature than are Jews theinselves. There may be some <br id="r2l49">
            
            truth in this, truth which is by no means a pleasant reflection on Jewish <br id="r2l50">
            
            theatre-goers. But, thank Heaven, it ouly applies to the least admirable <br id="r2l51">
            
            along our Community, and is not unconnected with that ugly symnptom <br id="r2l52">
            
            of immnority self-consciousness which, misunderstood and not examined <br id="r2l53">
            
            with a symnpathetie reference to its causes, mag have helped to produce <br id="r2l54">
            
            that popular theory that the persecuted “generallv ask for it.“' Let <br id="r2l55">
            
            us hope that on this occasion the London Jewish Comnmunitv will give <br id="r2l56">
            
            practical refutation to Mr. Carroll’s suggestion—no oue will be more <br id="r2l57">
            
            gratified than that distinguished writer himself. <br id="r2l58">
            
            The cast at the Phoenix is largely the same as that at the former <br id="r2l59">
            
            production. Again Abraham Sofaer gives a magnificent performance <br id="r2l60">
            
            as the Professor. It it amusing to hear people blaming the Jewish <br id="r2l61">
            
            doctor’s stubbornness, merelg because he insisted on doing what was, <br id="r2l62">
            
            in his view, unquestionablz right. How the forcc of morality has weakened <br id="r2l63">
            
            since the day's of the categorical imperative! Mr. Sofaer suggests a <br id="r2l64">
            
            genuinelg Jewish moral determination and thie prophetie refusal to com¬ <br id="r2l65">
            
            promise, combined with a deep humane kindliness which sees in man, <br id="r2l66">
            
            physical and suffering man, not a play-thing for the gods, but the image <br id="r2l67">
            
            of God Hunself. It is a noble and inspiring performance, inevitably <br id="r2l68">
            
            winning our syinpathy ichere we are not too prejidiced. Ronald Adam’s <br id="r2l69">
            
            version of the political opportunist is again delightful, wickedly true to <br id="r2l70">
            
            life and oozing the unctuonsness of the fellow. Earle Grey takes the <br id="r2l71">
            
            cold and scheming Ebenwald in a very convincing manner, the true <br id="r2l72">
            
            obnoxionsness of which, as happens in real life with such persons, rises <br id="r2l73">
            
            more as an after-odour thian upon innnediate contact—a clever piece of <br id="r2l74">
            
            acting. <br id="r2l75">
            
            For every one who is not entirely devoid of brains,“ Bernhardi'' <br id="r2l76">
            
            presents a real theatre treat—intelligently, exeiting, topically valuable <br id="r2l77">
            
            and lasting in its impressiveness. For the Jew, it presents a double <br id="r2l78">
            
            attraction, for-beeis not merelg outstle it all but verr much Vof'’ the <br id="r2l79">
