            TWO PLAYS AT THE VAUDEVILLE THEATRE. <br id="r1l7">
            
            It is regrettable that“ Collision?' should have had so short a <br id="r1l8">
            
            run, for it was an interesting play of considerable merit, and, <br id="r1l9">
            
            despite its technical flavour, deserved support; but the public thin <br id="r1l10">
            
            season sccms to be set against serious drama. Last night ###o <br id="r1l11">
            
            one-act pieces of substantial length were presented at the Vaude¬ <br id="r1l12">
            
            ville, and introduced by a short song-recital, which I do not feci <br id="r1l13">
            
            myself competentto criticise. Still, 1 should like to say that Mies <br id="r1l14">
            
            Gertrude Rolffs rendered a dramatic song called“ The Song oi <br id="r1l15">
            
            Misery? with quite thrilling power. The ordinary performanse <br id="r1l16">
            
            began with a play in four scenes by Mr. Hermon Quld, called <br id="r1l17">
            
            * Between Sunset and Dawn. It is a tragedy of humble lisc, <br id="r1l18">
            
            written with some ability. The chief figures are Bill Higgins, <br id="r1l19">
            
            exact calling unknown, his wile Liz, and Jim Harris, keeper of a <br id="r1l20">
            
            “ duss-house, ?' so humble that acccmmodation could be obtained <br id="r1l21">
            
            for as little as a penny. Bill iiggins is a voung drunkard who <br id="r1l22">
            
            knocks his wite about, so she runs away, and late at night comes <br id="r1l23">
            
            tothe doss-house. Jim falls in love with her, and begs her to <br id="r1l24">
            
            come and live with him, and after scruples on the ground of respec¬ <br id="r1l25">
            
            tability she consents, but a lew minutes later gocs back to her <br id="r1l26">
            
            husband. Bill is jealous, am after a row attempts to assault her, <br id="r1l27">
            
            So she runs away again, and returns to the doss-house. Jim is a <br id="r1l28">
            
            littie chilled after hearing the truth, and withdraws his invitation, <br id="r1l29">
            
            but when she is going awav fires up again, and soon discovers that <br id="r1l30">
            
            though she consents to live with him she prefers the husband. <br id="r1l31">
            
            Then he invites her to sit down, adopts a queer idiotic manner <br id="r1l32">
            
            which 1 do not understand, asks her #o kiss him, and when she is <br id="r1l33">
            
            about to do so, stabs her fatallz. I am still päzzled by the idiotic <br id="r1l34">
            
            demeancur in the last scene, and perhaps in consequence of my <br id="r1l35">
            
            ignorance do not feel at all satisfied about the truth of the play <br id="r1l36">
            
            on the whole. This is unfortunate in the case of a work of such <br id="r1l37">
            
            a grim character. It may be a profound study; if so, my judgment <br id="r1l38">
            
            isat fault. Mr. Norman McKinnel acted with considerable force <br id="r1l39">
            
            as Jim without being quite convincing. Miss May Blayney, in the <br id="r1l40">
            
            part of the wife, though there was skill in her performance, did not <br id="r1l41">
            
            succeed in keeping back the idea that she was a lady representing <br id="r1l42">
            
            one of the almost submerged. There was some merit in the <br id="r1l43">
            
            acting of Mr. Edmond Breon as Bill. <br id="r1l44">
            
            The second piece was Schiitzler’s comedy“ The Green Cocka¬ <br id="r1l45">
            
            too, presented in March of last year by the Stage Society, and <br id="r1l46">
            
            subsequently published in book form, though in another transla¬ <br id="r1l47">

            little drama with vivid thumb-nail sketches of character presenting <br id="r1l49">
            
            an episode of the beginning of the French Revolution, and bringing <br id="r1l50">

            of real characters acting and reucting on one another, and is <br id="r1l53">
            
            worked up with great skill to a big climax. The performance <br id="r1l54">
            
            is more notable for general excellence than great individual merit. <br id="r1l55">

            Messrs. Edward Rigby, A. G. Poulton, and Leslie Carter. The <br id="r1l58">

            Play. <br id="r2l11">
            
            It was an interesting evening at the Vamleville last <br id="r2l12">
            
            night, when Messis. Norman Mekinnel and Frederick <br id="r2l13">
            
            Whelen presented what was in the nature of a triple bill. <br id="r2l14">
            
            But, as the first part was musical and the last was a <br id="r2l15">
            
            revival, chief attention müst be centred upon the second¬ <br id="r2l16">
            
            item, which was a piece in four scenes by Hermon Quld, <br id="r2l17">
            
            By this it <br id="r2l18">
            
            entitled“ Between Sunset and Dawn. <br id="r2l19">
            
            should not be inferred that the miniature recital of their <br id="r2l20">
            
            own songs by Miss Gertrude Rolffs and Mr. Anton¬ <br id="r2l21">
            
            Dressler fell upon unappreciative cars. On the contrary, <br id="r2l22">
            
            both the vocal and creative abilities and the fine dramatie <br id="r2l23">
            
            manner in which they were delivered to the brilliant <br id="r2l24">

            nised in no uncertain manner by the audience. <br id="r2l26">
            
            The title of the evening’s novelty is a good one, and, <br id="r2l27">
            
            it must be confessed, filled one with more confidence <br id="r2l28">
            
            before the curtain rose than just immediately after. For, <br id="r2l29">
            
            truth to tell, those zho had not studied well their pro¬ <br id="r2l30">
            
            gramme, and seen that the first section took place in the <br id="r2l31">
            
            kitchen of Mrs. Harris s dosshouse in South London, felt <br id="r2l32">
            
            a sense of disappointment that the characters and scenes <br id="r2l33">
            
            fealt with London“ low life. It stands to the credit <br id="r2l34">
            
            pf those concerned, players and author alike, that this <br id="r2l35">
            
            feeling soon gave way to one of eager attention. Inter¬ <br id="r2l36">
            
            preters of a new play seldom receive their dud, for, on <br id="r2l37">
            
            account of.the exigencies of space, the author gets most <br id="r2l38">
            
            of the notice; but there is no doubt that the stimulating <br id="r2l39">
            
            ##ffectof the acting of Mr. Norman Mekinnel, as Jim <br id="r2l40">
            
            Harris, and of Miss Ada King, as Jim s mother, in the <br id="r2l41">
            
            first moments of the piece, had its influence right through <br id="r2l42">
            
            to the end. <br id="r2l43">
            
            Between Sunset and Dawn has qufte the Gals¬ <br id="r2l44">
            
            worthy touch, but the scenes are handled with more <br id="r2l45">
            
            realism and less decision. For as a matter of fact, it is <br id="r2l46">
            
            difficult to decide which of the two forbidding male speci¬ <br id="r2l47">

            man, and is driven by a storm into a penny doss¬ <br id="r2l55">
            
            house, just as Mrs. Harris, whose tongue s as sharp as <br id="r2l56">
            
            her thirst, is being candidly rebuked by her big, slow, <br id="r2l57">
