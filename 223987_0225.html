            see the craziness working in hin face. There <br id="r3l28">

            back to the wall, and he supplies it. He picks <br id="r3l30">
            
            up a knife from the table and stabs her as <br id="r3l31">
            
            she gives him his first caress from woman. <br id="r3l32">
            
            Mr. Norman McKinnel was splendid as the <br id="r3l33">
            
            bemused Jim, and Miss May Blayney as Liz <br id="r3l34">
            
            Higgins gave a piece of restrained, perfect <br id="r3l35">
            
            character acting, with every little point made, <br id="r3l36">
            
            such as is rarely seen on the stage. In the <br id="r3l37">
            
            final scene the madness gradually creeping <br id="r3l38">

            Brcon as the cowardly and blustering Bill <br id="r3l43">
            
            Higgins, were both excellent. The piece itself <br id="r3l44">
            
            was very warmly received. It secmed a pity <br id="r3l45">
            
            that the author could find no way out excepe <br id="r3l46">
            
            the table knife, but that was how poor Jim <br id="r3l47">
            
            saw the situation. In a way, it is too much <br id="r3l48">
            
            to ask us to believe that the situation would <br id="r3l49">
            
            have turned Jim’s head, but Mr. MeKinnel <br id="r3l50">
            
            certainly realised it on the stage. <br id="r3l51">

            THE TRAGEDY. <br id="r3l69">
            
            The best of the barnstorming crew is Henry, <br id="r3l70">
            
            a genius in his way, who has just marrisd <br id="r3l71">
            
            Léocadie, an actress of generous amours. <br id="r3l72">
            
            Henry comes in and recites, fo the general <br id="r3l73">
            
            horror, how he has just killed the Duc de <br id="r3l74">
            
            Cadignan because he discovered him in bis <br id="r3l75">
            
            wife’s dressing-room at the Porte St. Martin <br id="r3l76">
            
            Theatre. The spell of horror is broken by <br id="r3l77">
            
            the entrance of the Duke, and everybody, <br id="r3l78">
            
            noblemen, noble dames, and tatterdemalions, <br id="r3l79">
            
            realise that it was önly Henry’s little joke— <br id="r3l80">
            
            but a brilliant onc. But at the same moment <br id="r3l81">
            
            Henry realises that what he has been joking <br id="r3l82">
            
            about is true in fact, and he stabs the Duke <br id="r3l83">
            
            just as the rabble burst in frem the taking of <br id="r3l84">
            
            the Bastille. And the curtain comes down <br id="r3l85">
            
            on the nobles fighting their way out of the <br id="r3l86">
            
            cellar, the whiole big joke of the crew who <br id="r3l87">
            
            as actors have been wonr to spit at the amüsed <br id="r3l88">
            
            aristocrats suddenly turned to grim reality. <br id="r3l89">
            
            Unfortunately, one could not help ccmpar¬ <br id="r3l90">
            
            ing last night’s performance with the previous <br id="r3l91">
            
            one, and it suffered by that comparison in all <br id="r3l92">
            
            points. There was too much shouting, so that <br id="r3l93">
            
            the rather involved action of the piece was <br id="r3l94">
            
            obscured. The stage also is hardly big cnough <br id="r3l95">
            
            for what has to take place on it. But those <br id="r3l96">
            
            who did not see the first performance will ho¬ <br id="r3l97">
            
            doubt enjoy this one very much. Mr. Norman <br id="r3l98">
            
            Mekinnel played Henry, but he did not <br id="r3l99">
            
            realise the quaint mixture of genius and <br id="r3l100">
