            frame of mind he can't help but suspect. <br id="r1l53">
            
            you? <br id="r1l54">

            GIL.—What are you going to distribute, if I may be so bold <br id="r1l56">

            GIL.—Madame—Baron, may I offer you a copy of my book <br id="r1l76">
            
            MARG.—I’ve made up my mind. <br id="r1l77">
            
            as a token that all ill-feeling between us has vanished? As a <br id="r1l78">
            
            GIL.—Indeed, have a care. For, if you do, I shall sell my <br id="r1l79">
            
            feeble sign of my sympathy, Baron? <br id="r1l80">
