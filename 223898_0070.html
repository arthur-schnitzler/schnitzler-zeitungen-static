            Of these two novels, Der Gehülfe, by a young writer <br id="r1l15">
            
            vho has already made his mark, is full of the freshness of <br id="r1l16">
            
            recent experience. It seems to bubble over with sug¬ <br id="r1l17">
            
            gestions, of which the writer is himself, possibly, unsware. <br id="r1l18">
            
            Der Weg ins Freie' is by a tried and proved craftsman, <br id="r1l19">
            
            1 cultivated observer and man of the world, a writer, it <br id="r1l20">
            
            may elmost be said, of genius. Like his play Der Ruf <br id="r1l21">
            
            Ies Ledens, this novel is woven upon a definite design, <br id="r1l22">
            
            of#ich the idea expressed in the title is the principal <br id="r1l23">
            
            thread. What strikes an English reader first in the picture <br id="r1l24">
            
            of Viennese life, vivid and attractive in many ways as it is, <br id="r1l25">
            
            is the moral laxity not only practised, but apparently con¬ <br id="r1l26">
            
            doned by persons who would be called, in our phrase, <br id="r1l27">
            
            respectable. Vienna, the city of music and of beautiful <br id="r1l28">
            
            women, has the reputation of being as gay and irresponsible <br id="r1l29">
            
            as any capital in Europe. Irresponsibility is certeinly <br id="r1l30">
            
            the“ note“ of every character in the book. No man is <br id="r1l31">
            
            his brother’s keeper. And perhaps this is der Weg#ins <br id="r1l32">
            
            Freie. <br id="r1l33">
            
            The hero, Georg von Wergenthin, a musical and attractive <br id="r1l34">
            
            young man, is a sort of Don Juan malyré lus. The favourite <br id="r1l35">
            
            son of his mother, theidol of sisters andof married women, <br id="r1l36">
            
            young and old, the jolly goad fellow of his men friends, <br id="r1l37">
            
            in short, the lovable, and, therefore, the beloved. In the <br id="r1l38">
            
            hands of a Thackeray, or a Dickens, we should look for <br id="r1l39">
            
            some unpleasant consequences of his pleasant vices. But <br id="r1l40">
            
            that is not the way with Schnitzler, his creator. Georg <br id="r1l41">
            
            is a type, but he is highly individualized. His mother, <br id="r1l42">
            
            a singer by profession, but of good burgher family, is part <br id="r1l43">
            
            cause of his musical gift. His father, whose recent death <br id="r1l44">
            
            is the first ineident mentioned, was an aristocrat of taste <br id="r1l45">
            
            and culture. Georg's tastes naturally lead him into musical <br id="r1l46">
            
            and somewhat unconventional circles, and, therefore, in <br id="r1l47">
            
            Vienna, among Jews. He forms a connexion with one of <br id="r1l48">
            
            these, a teacher of singing, named Anna Rosner. She finds <br id="r1l49">
            
            herself about to become a mother, and the Preparations <br id="r1l50">
            
            made by the unmarried pair for the birth of the ebild, <br id="r1l51">
            
            the birth itself, the sufferings of the mother, and the death <br id="r1l52">
            
            of the child before it was born, are all described with e minute¬ <br id="r1l53">
            
            ness of detail which would be wearisome did we not recog¬ <br id="r1l54">
            
            nize in it the conscious purpose of the artist. The author <br id="r1l55">
            
            seems to accept and even to approve freedom from moral <br id="r1l56">
            
            law (der Weg ins Freie) in the relations of man and woman, <br id="r1l57">
            
            except in so far as these result in the production of offspring. <br id="r1l58">
            
            But, if we interpret aright, fatherhood and motherhood, <br id="r1l59">
            
            particularly the former, carry with them obligations mutual <br id="r1l60">
            
            and reciprocal, all the more rigid for the freedom permi <br id="r1l61">
            
            in other circumstances. On the very first page, pe <br id="r1l62">
            
            and sigmäcant emphasis is laid on Georg’s affectio <br id="r1l63">
            
            his own father. Georg, the light-hearted and in <br id="r1l64">
            
            sionable, is profoundly affected by the loss of the <br id="r1l65">
            
            that“ was dead before it was born.“ He assunied tacit <br id="r1l66">
            
            in his own mind that his connexion with Anna would <br id="r1l67">
            
            become permanent should the child live, and sbis, not <br id="r1l68">
            
            from the idea of making an honest woman of her.! Anna <br id="r1l69">
            
            professes herself rather proud than ashamed of her mother¬ <br id="r1l70">
            
            hood, and their connexion is such an open secret that <br id="r1l71">
            
            another Jewess, Else Ehrenberg (whose own relatio <br id="r1l72">
            
            Georg are very delicately sketched) offers to adopt th <br id="r1l73">
            
            pon her own marriage with the English diplomat <br id="r1l74">

            averse from settling in Palestine. He makes a pilgrimage <br id="r1l77">
            
            to Jerusalem, and gazes on the home of his fathers, in <br id="r1l78">
            
            the same spirit in which a good Bostonian used <br id="r1l79">
            
            to visit Stratford-on-Avon. <br id="r1l80">
            
            Eise herself is the cultivated Jewess, the flower of the <br id="r1l81">
