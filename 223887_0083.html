            that. an officer of the Empeor’s pet <br id="r1l32">
            
            regiment must, above all, respect a <br id="r1l33">
            
            debt of honor. The only way out if <br id="r1l34">
            
            an officer does not see his way clear <br id="r1l35">
            
            to meet the debt promptly is to put a <br id="r1l36">
            
            bullet through his brain, which one <br id="r1l37">
            
            of Kasda’s comrades does in the <br id="r1l38">
            
            early stages of this tale. <br id="r1l39">
            
            So far as Kasda is concerned, he <br id="r1l40">
            
            is urged by his uncle, General von <br id="r1l41">
            
            Hartz, cleverly acted by C. Aubrey <br id="r1l42">
            
            Smith. to marry the daughter of <br id="r1l43">
            
            wealthy parents. This, Kasda is op¬ <br id="r1l44">
            
            posed to, but as his finances are at <br id="r1l45">
            
            a very low ebb, he does not see how <br id="r1l46">
            
            he can avold it. It is against the <br id="r1l47">
            
            regelations of his regiment for an <br id="r1l48">
            
            officer to wed a girl in a humble <br id="r1l49">
            
            station of life and therefore Kasda’s <br id="r1l50">
            
            chances of making Laura his wife <br id="r1l51">
            
            are remote. <br id="r1l52">
            
            In oneof the several interesting <br id="r1l53">
            
            sequences, another young officer of <br id="r1l54">
            
            the guards finds himself in debt to <br id="r1l55">
            
            the tune of 2.000 gulden. He thinks <br id="r1l56">
            
            that he will have to kill himself. <br id="r1l57">
            
            but Kasda comes to his rescue, first <br id="r1l58">
            
            by collecting 300 gulden from the <br id="r1l59">
            
            other officers and then by gambling <br id="r1l60">
            
            at chemin de fer ard winning the <br id="r1l61">
            
            desired sum, plus 400 gulden. Laura’s <br id="r1l62">
            
            friend, a coarse individual named <br id="r1l63">
            
            Schnabel, loses the money. <br id="r1l64">
            
            After giving his comrade in arms <br id="r1l65">
            
            th 2,000 guldens. Kasda decides to <br id="r1l66">
            
            try his luck with the surplus but <br id="r1l67">
            
            ##he cards are against him and he <br id="r1l68">
            
            leaves the table owing Schnabel <br id="r1l69">
            
            14,000 gulden. So Kasda finds him¬ <br id="r1l70">
            
            self in the same predicament as the <br id="r1l71">
            
            comrade he had helped. His avunc¬ <br id="r1l72">
            
            ular relative, the General, however. <br id="r1l73">
            
            comes to his assistance, but first he <br id="r1l74">
            
            insists that Kasda marry the wealthy <br id="r1l75">
            
            girl. The young officer refuses to do <br id="r1l76">
            
            this and the General takes back the <br id="r1l77">
            
            money. General von Hartz finally <br id="r1l78">
            
            relents and sends the 14,000 gulden <br id="r1l79">
            
            to the ignoble Schnabel. And in the <br id="r1l80">
            
            end Kasda arranges matters so that <br id="r1l81">
            
            he can marry Laura. <br id="r1l82">
            
            Miss Chandler is particularly good <br id="r1l83">
            
            when she as Laura shares a bottle of <br id="r1l84">
            
            wine with Kasda. It is her first in¬ <br id="r1l85">
            
            toxicating drink, and her portrayal <br id="r1l86">
            
            of the result is natural and re¬ <br id="r1l87">
            
            strained. C. Aubrey Smith, looking <br id="r1l88">
            
            a fine figure of a man in a general’s <br id="r1l89">
