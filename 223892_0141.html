            had lapsed into the independent selfish <br id="r1l53">
            
            seclusion of a reasonably successkul <br id="r1l54">

            is a far more convincing example of his art than <br id="r3l21">
            
            the books he has written since, and one more likely <br id="r3l22">
            
            to be classed with the best in present-day German <br id="r3l23">

            The three love affairs of the typically Schnitzlerian <br id="r3l25">
            
            hero are not, perhaps, interesting in themselves. <br id="r3l26">
            
            Neither the man northe women seem to expect <br id="r3l27">
            
            much from them and are willing to resign them¬ <br id="r3l28">
            
            selves to fate when things appear to go against their <br id="r3l29">
            
            happiness, nor is any one of the affairs notable in <br id="r3l30">
            
            any way for its spiritual quality. Fräulein Sabine <br id="r3l31">
            
            never seems quite real even to her lover, while <br id="r3l32">
            
            Katharina is merely a caprice that turned out badly. <br id="r3l33">
            
            The final disposal of Dr. Grzesler upon Frau Som¬ <br id="r3l34">
            
            mer is the triumph of disillusionment rather than <br id="r3l35">
            
            love. In these circumstances the distinction of <br id="r3l36">
            
            Schnitzler’s method is that it reduces all these cases <br id="r3l37">
            
            to a low common denominator of actuality, making <br id="r3l38">
            
            them so incredibly clear and lifelike that only the <br id="r3l39">
            
            most prejudiced will be unwilling to admit their <br id="r3l40">
            
            truth. The clarity is a little too dazzling to be <br id="r3l41">
            
            moving, perhaps, but Schnitzler has other and more <br id="r3l42">
            
            scientific ends in view. It is safe to say that in this <br id="r3l43">
            
            case a medical man is treated with medical thorough¬ <br id="r3l44">
            
            ness, yet never with the complete detachment from <br id="r3l45">
            
            his character which makes the later work of Schnitz¬ <br id="r3l46">
