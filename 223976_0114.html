            inspired by your first husband. Besides, he could never appre¬ <br id="r2l6">

            MARG.—Certainly not. That’s why I brought suit for <br id="r2l10">
            
            have heard much about sportsmanship from your friends in <br id="r2l11">
            
            divorce. You know the story. I just couldn't bear living with <br id="r2l12">
            
            Munich—at least, as far as I am able to judge. <br id="r2l13">
            
            a man who had no other interest in life than eating and <br id="r2l14">
            
            drinking and cotton. <br id="r2l15">
            
            MARG.—I do hope you will stop tormenting me about those <br id="r2l16">
            
            friends in whose company you first made my acquaintance. <br id="r2l17">
            
            CLEM.—I dare say. But that was three years ago. These <br id="r2l18">
            
            poems were written later. <br id="r2l19">
            
            CLEM.—Tormenting you? Nonsense! Only it’s incompre¬ <br id="r2l20">
            
            hensible to me how you ever got amongst those people. <br id="r2l21">
            
            MARG.—Quite so. But consider the position in which I <br id="r2l22">
            
            found myself— <br id="r2l23">
            
            MARG.—You speak of them as if they were a gang of <br id="r2l24">
            
            criminals. <br id="r2l25">
            
            CLEM.—What do you mean? You didn't ave to endure <br id="r2l26">
            
            CLEM.—Dearest, I’d stake my honor on it, some of them <br id="r2l27">
            
            any privation? In this respect you must admit your husband <br id="r2l28">
            
            looked the very picture of pickpockets. Tell me, how did you <br id="r2l29">
            
            acted very decently toward you. You were not under the <br id="r2l30">
            
            manage to do it? I can't understand how you, with your re¬ <br id="r2l31">
            
            necessity of earning your own living. And suppose the pub¬ <br id="r2l32">
            
            fined taste—let alone your purity and the scent you used— <br id="r2l33">
            
            lishers did pay you one hundred gulden for a poem—surely, <br id="r2l34">
            
            could have tolerated their society. How could you have sat <br id="r2l35">
            
            they don't pay more than that—still, you were not bound to <br id="r2l36">
            
            at the same table with them. <br id="r2l37">
            
            write a book of this sort. <br id="r2l38">
            
            MARG. (laughing)—Didn't you do the same? <br id="r2l39">
            
            MARG.—I did not refer to position in a material sense. It <br id="r2l40">
            
            CLEM.—Next to them—not with them. And for your sake <br id="r2l41">
            
            was the state of my soul. Have you a notion how—when <br id="r2l42">
            
            —merely for your sake, as you know. To do them justice, <br id="r2l43">
            
            you came to know merthings were considerably improved. I <br id="r2l44">
            
            however, I will admit that many bettered upon closer acquaint¬ <br id="r2l45">
            
            had in many ways found myself again. But in the beginning! <br id="r2l46">
            
            ance. There were some interesting individuals among them. <br id="r2l47">
            
            I was so friendless, so crushed! I tried my hand at every¬ <br id="r2l48">
            
            You mustn't for a moment believe, dearest, that I hold myself <br id="r2l49">
            
            thing; I painted, I gave English lessons in the pension where <br id="r2l50">
            
            superior to folks who happen to be shabbily dressed. That’s <br id="r2l51">
            
            I lived. Just think of it! A divorcee, having nobody— <br id="r2l52">
            
            nothing against them. But there was something in their con¬ <br id="r2l53">
            
            CLEM.—Why didn't you stay in Vienna? <br id="r2l54">
            
            duct, in their manners, which was positively revolting. <br id="r2l55">
            
            MARG.—Because I couldn't get along with my family. No <br id="r2l56">
            
            MARG.—It wasn't quite so bad. <br id="r2l57">
            
            one appreciated me. Oh, what people! Did any one of them <br id="r2l58">
            
            CLEM.—Don't take offense, dear. I said there were some <br id="r2l59">
            
            realize that a woman of my type asks more of life than a hus¬ <br id="r2l60">
            
            interesting individuals among them. But that a lady should <br id="r2l61">
            
            band, pretty dresses and social position? My God! If I had <br id="r2l62">
            
            feel at ease in their company, for any length of time, I cannot <br id="r2l63">
            
            had a child, probably everything would have ended differently <br id="r2l64">
            
            and do not pretend to understand. <br id="r2l65">
            
            —and maybe not. I'm not quite lacking in accomplishments, <br id="r2l66">
            
            MARG.—You forget, dear Clem, that in a sense l'm one of <br id="r2l67">
            
            you know. Are you still prepared to complain? Was it not <br id="r2l68">
            
            them—or was at one time. <br id="r2l69">
            
            for the best that I went to Munich? Would I have made your <br id="r2l70">
            
            CLEM.—Now, please! For my sake! <br id="r2l71">
            
            acquaintance else? <br id="r2l72">
            
            MARG.—They were artists. <br id="r2l73">
            
            CLEM.—Vou didn't go there with that object in view. <br id="r2l74">
            
            CLEM.—Thank goodness, we’ve returned to the old theme. <br id="r2l75">
            
            MARG.—I wanted to be free—inwardly I mean. I wanted <br id="r2l76">
            
            MARG.—Yes, because it hurts me to think you always lose <br id="r2l77">
            
            to prove to myself whether I could succeed through my own <br id="r2l78">
            
            sight of that fact. <br id="r2l79">
            
            efforts. And, admit, didn't it look as if I was jolly well going <br id="r2l80">
            
            CLEM.—Lose sight of that fact! Nonsense! You know <br id="r2l81">
            
            to? I had made some headway on the road to fame. <br id="r2l82">
            
            what pained me in your writings—things entirely personal. <br id="r2l83">
            
            CLEM.—H'm! <br id="r2l84">
            
            MARG.—Let me tell you, Clem, there are women who, in <br id="r2l85">
            
            MARG.—But you were dearer to me than fame. <br id="r2l86">
            
            my situation, would have done worse than write poetry. <br id="r2l87">
            
            CLEM. (good-naturedly)—And surer. <br id="r2l88">
            
            CLEM.—But what sort of poetry! What sort of poetry! <br id="r2l89">
            
            MARG.—I didn't give it a thought. I suppose it’s because <br id="r2l90">
            
            (Takes a slender volume from the mantel-shelf.) That’s <br id="r2l91">
            
            I loved you from the very start. For in my dreams, I always <br id="r2l92">
            
            what repels me. I assure you, every time I see this book lying <br id="r2l93">
            
            conjure up a man of your likeness. I anways seemed to <br id="r2l94">
            
            here; every time I think of it, I blush with shame because yon <br id="r2l95">
            
            realize that it could only be a man like you who would make <br id="r2l96">
            
            wrote it. <br id="r2l97">
            
            me happy. Race—is no empty dream. Nothing whatever can <br id="r2l98">
            
            MARG.—That’s why vou fail to understand—Now, don't <br id="r2l99">
            
            weigh in the balance with that. You see, that’s why I can't <br id="r2l100">
            
            take offense. If you did understand, you'd be quite perfect, <br id="r2l101">
            
            resist the belief—. <br id="r2l102">
            
            and that, obviously, is impossible. Why does it repel you? <br id="r2l103">
            
            CLEM.—What? <br id="r2l104">
            
            You know I didn't live through all the experiences I write <br id="r2l105">
            
            MARG.—Oh, sometimes I think I must have noble blood <br id="r2l106">
            
            about. <br id="r2l107">
            
            in my veins, too. <br id="r2l108">
            
            CLEM.—I hope not. <br id="r2l109">
            
            CLEM.—How so? <br id="r2l110">
            
            MARG.—The poems are only visions. <br id="r2l111">
            
            MARG.—It’s not improbable? <br id="r2l112">
            
            CLEM.—That’s just it. That’s what makes me inquire: <br id="r2l113">
            
            CLEM.—I'm afraid I don't understand. <br id="r2l114">
            
            Hov can a lady indulge in visions of that character? (Reads.) <br id="r2l115">
            
            MARG.—But I told you that any number of the aristocracy <br id="r2l116">
            
            Abandoned on thy breast and suckled by thy lips' (shaling <br id="r2l117">
