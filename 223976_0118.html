            my book which you didn't even get. They were, in my opin¬ <br id="r1l68">

            more piquant. <br id="r1l73">
            
            MARG—Merciful heavens! If this is so—(turning the <br id="r1l74">
            
            leares of Gilbert's book). Ves, yes, it is so. Why, it’s just <br id="r1l75">
            
            MARG.—Then she doesn't go to Munich, but to Dresden; <br id="r1l76">
