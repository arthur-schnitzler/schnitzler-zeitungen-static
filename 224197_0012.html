            absclute frankness. When their son is five years old a prince begins to pay <br id="r1l7">
            
            attentions to Cecilia and Adams falls in love with a frivolous countess. <br id="r1l8">
            
            They tell each other all the details and resolve to live on together as friends <br id="r1l9">
            
            and colleagucs. Adams continues his flirtation for a short time, but is <br id="r1l10">
            
            soon sobered. Cecilia goes to Berlin, where she is feted by the prince, and <br id="r1l11">
            
            makes new conquests. When she returns from this engagement, Adams <br id="r1l12">
            
            falls in love with her again and insists upon his rights. Heat once decides <br id="r1l13">
            
            that he must fight a duel with the prince, but learns that Cecilia has tol¬ <br id="r1l14">
            
            erated the prince’s attentions for the sole purpose of winning back Adams. <br id="r1l15">
            
            The events, however, have so disturbed Cacilia’s peace of mind that she <br id="r1l16">
            
            cannot proceed to live with Adams until she has gained further clarity in <br id="r1l17">
            
            regard to their whole relationship. She realizes that what they had taken <br id="r1l18">
            
            for truthfulness has been alie. Had we at that time cried out our anger, <br id="r1l19">
            
            bitterness, and despair, instead of acting composed and serene, we should <br id="r1l20">
            
            have been truthful — Amadeus — and we were not.' <br id="r1l21">
            
            As a physician Schnitzler had witnessed the tenacity with which per¬ <br id="r1l22">
            
            sons cling to mere life. In The Call of Life' (°06) this impulse is pre¬ <br id="r1l23">
            
            sented as the key to the actions of a number of characters. Moser, an <br id="r1l24">
            
            officer, at the critical moment before the battle, thinks of the possibilities <br id="r1l25">
            
            of the life whlich he is about to sacrifice. His cowardice unsettles the whole <br id="r1l26">
            
            battalion and is responsible for its defeat. He is dismissed in disgrace and <br id="r1l27">
            
            proceeds to seck his happiness. His wife and later his daughter are sub¬ <br id="r1l28">
            
            jected to cruelty and abuse. To this abuse the mother finally succumbs <br id="r1l29">
            
            and the daughter assumes full responsibility for the invalid father. His <br id="r1l30">
            
            selfishness makes him morbidly suspicious. He fears that the daughter <br id="r1l31">
            
            will desert him and imposes the greatest hardships upon her. Schnitzler, <br id="r1l32">
            
            the physician, is so thoroughly exasperated at his conduct that he leaves <br id="r1l33">
            
            a rather strong sleeping potion for the old martinet. The love of life also <br id="r1l34">
            
            asserts itself in Marie, the daughter. The devoted love of Schnitzier evokes <br id="r1l35">
            
            no response in her, but she becomes infatuated with Max, an officer of her <br id="r1l36">
            
            fathers old company. This company has decided to go to certain death <br id="r1l37">
            
            on the next day in order to wipe out the disgrace of its former retreat. <br id="r1l38">
            
            When Marie hears that Max expects her for a last farewell, she administers <br id="r1l39">
            
            the sleeping potion to her father and hurries to the barracks. Here she <br id="r1l40">
            
            conceals herself and thus learns more of Max’s affairs. Max has had a <br id="r1l41">
            
            love affair with the wife of his major, and she comes to implore him to flee <br id="r1l42">
            
            with her. While she is here the major enters and promptly kills her. He <br id="r1l43">
            
            demands that Max should keep the affair secret until the following morning <br id="r1l44">
            
            and stand for the deed if necessary. Marie comes from her hiding place <br id="r1l45">
            
            and implores Max to flee with her. When he refuses to do this, she im¬ <br id="r1l46">
            
            plores him to die with her, but he kills himself at the side of the wife whom <br id="r1l47">
