            the art and culture of the future. <br id="r3l55">
            
            That is why I was so eager to vislt <br id="r3l56">
            
            America, to tryto feel lts atmosphere <br id="r3l57">

            Lewis which is simply lacking over <br id="r3l81">
            
            here. Such prose—palpltant and <br id="r3l82">
            
            allve—could have come only from an <br id="r3l83">
            
            American. And such messages, as <br id="r3l84">
            
            their novels express, are intrinsically <br id="r3l85">
            
            American. As for Eugene O’Neill, he <br id="r3l86">

            business of the #aside“ is neither <br id="r3l91">
            
            orlginal nor of artistic importance, it <br id="r3l92">
            
            seeis to me. It is such a nalve trick <br id="r3l93">
            
            to tell what Is in a character’s mind <br id="r3l94">
            
            which a little bit of subtlety would <br id="r3l95">
