            not the dream of the sole complement, the <br id="tr_1_tl_71">

            as his most important work, yet as his <br id="tr_2_tl_10">
            
            most effective drama. As a matter of fact <br id="tr_2_tl_11">
            
            Schnitzler never before aimed so high. The <br id="tr_2_tl_12">
            
            play is composed of three tragedies which <br id="tr_2_tl_13">
            
            are interwoven with and embrace one an¬ <br id="tr_2_tl_14">
            
            other; the drama of Medardus, Napoleon in <br id="tr_2_tl_15">
            
            Vienna and the Duke of Valis' dream of <br id="tr_2_tl_16">

            events made a fool of him," says one of the <br id="tr_2_tl_20">

            figure of a great traged. Here undeniably <br id="tr_2_tl_25">
            
            there is a defect in this eminent work of <br id="tr_2_tl_26">
            
            art; the hero is a half-man who never him¬ <br id="tr_2_tl_27">

            of a novel. But the crimson background <br id="tr_2_tl_30">
            
            of the work is grand, the rushing torrent <br id="tr_2_tl_31">
            
            of episodes, the abundance of living <br id="tr_2_tl_32">

            defects? It seems to us that the essence <br id="tr_2_tl_53">
            
            of his merit lies in the fact that he handles <br id="tr_2_tl_54">

            pegs on which to hang violently theatrica <br id="tr_2_tl_58">
            
            stage effects. Some problem may constitute <br id="tr_2_tl_59">
            
            the centre of most of his plays; yet, with <br id="tr_2_tl_60">
            
            a few exceptions, this problem is not pre¬ <br id="tr_2_tl_61">
            
            sented too rakedly or without sufficient <br id="tr_2_tl_62">
            
            relief. Each problem is bathed in an ar¬ <br id="tr_2_tl_63">

            the picture limned with the most subti¬ <br id="tr_2_tl_65">
            
            psychology. <br id="tr_2_tl_66">
            
            It is true that, as has already been plat- <br id="tr_2_tl_67">
            
            ed out, many of the acts in his longe <br id="tr_2_tl_68">

            to fashionable life? <br id="tr_2_tl_81">
            
            It is true that the ethics of these plays <br id="tr_2_tl_82">
            
            with their chronic and inevitable intrigues, <br id="tr_2_tl_83">
            
            may strike the English mind as somewhat <br id="tr_2_tl_84">
            
            unusual: yet Schnitzler enjoys the reputa¬ <br id="tr_2_tl_85">

            ethics, but the presentation of the problem <br id="tr_2_tl_90">
            
            Yet, with all his subtlety and all his <br id="tr_2_tl_91">
            
            problems, he is never happy. Vienna stand¬ <br id="tr_2_tl_92">
            
            intellectually nearer to Paris than to Berlin <br id="tr_2_tl_93">
            
            so that the Teutonic introspection and senti¬ <br id="tr_2_tl_94">
