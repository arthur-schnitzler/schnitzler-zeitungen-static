            AFTERNOON WITH SCHNITZLER. <br id="r2l7">
            
            To the ordinary English playgoer the name of <br id="r2l8">
            
            Arthur Schnitzler is mainly familiar by rcason of <br id="r2l9">
            
            his Anatol sketches, translated and produced by <br id="r2l10">
            
            Mr. Granvilie Barker. Testerday, at a particularly <br id="r2l11">
            
            interesting matinée given at the Aldwych by the <br id="r2l12">
            
            Incorpomtei Stage Society, we had the privilege of <br id="r2l13">
            
            making his better acquaintance. The two one-act <br id="r2l14">
            
            pieccs presented serred admirably to emphasise the <br id="r2l15">
            
            scope of his peculiar talent. Comtesse Mizzi“' is <br id="r2l16">
            
            quite in the vein of Anatol.“ It is heavily <br id="r2l17">
            
            charged—overcharged, some might insist—with <br id="r2l18">
            
            cynicism; it provides, with a light-heartedness that <br id="r2l19">
            
            almost appals, an extraordinary study of the bacer <br id="r2l20">
            
            aspecis of social life. The characters are more or <br id="r2l21">
            
            less tarred with tho same brush; they are entirely <br id="r2l22">
            
            unmoral and frankly boastful of the fact. One might <br id="r2l23">
            
            speak of them as degenerates, were it not that they <br id="r2l24">
            
            take such a healthy pride in their own misdoings. <br id="r2l25">
            
            You have, for instanco, Prince Ravenstein, who has <br id="r2l26">
            
            seduced the daughter of his friend, Count Pazmandy, <br id="r2l27">
            
            the Countess Mizzi. The result of their intrigue is a <br id="r2l28">
            
            son. Philip whom his mother has not even cared to <br id="r2l29">
            
            recognase, and who, although little more than a youth, <br id="r2l30">
            
            has developed tastes very much on a par with those <br id="r2l31">
            
            indulged in by his father. Count Pazmandy is him¬ <br id="r2l32">
            
            self a viveur of the first order. For many years he <br id="r2l33">
            
            has livod on a basis of intimacy with a notorious <br id="r2l34">
            
            dancer called Lolo, who in the end calmly throws <br id="r2l35">
            
            him over in order to marry a well-to-do livery-stable <br id="r2l36">
            
            proprietor. <br id="r2l37">
            
            The play is little more than a series of conversa¬ <br id="r2l38">
            
            tions, carried on with a most perfect and unblushing <br id="r2l39">
            
            candour by these and other charncters, and would <br id="r2l40">
            
            be intolerable were it handled in a less witty fashion. <br id="r2l41">
            
            When the serious things of life are presented in so <br id="r2l42">
            
            Ifrivolous a spimt they scem, however, to lose some¬ <br id="r2l43">
            
            thing of their importance, and Schnitzler plays the <br id="r2l44">
            
            Jester so airily that he well-nigh tempts us to forget <br id="r2l45">
            
            the gravity of the enormities he unmasks. It is, <br id="r2l46">
            
            of course, essential to the well-being of such a piece <br id="r2l47">
            
            that theoriginal atmosphereand surroundings should <br id="r2l48">
            
            bepreserved. Norcanitbeexpectedthat Englishartists <br id="r2l49">
            
            should quite succeed in giving the requisite form <br id="r2l50">
            
            and substance to ideas so entirely beyond their ken. <br id="r2l51">
            
            Mr. Athol Stowart, nevertheless, is to be congratu¬ <br id="r2l52">
            
            lated on his clever rendering of the part of Prince <br id="r2l53">
            
            Ravenstein; while Mr. Robert Horton as Count <br id="r2l54">
            
            Pazmandy, Miss Katherine Polo as Mizzi, and Miss <br id="r2l55">
            
            Margaret Busse as Lolo gavc a very fair acconnt of <br id="r2l56">
            
            thomselves. Although merely a thumbnail sketch, <br id="r2l57">
            
            Mr. Rupert Lumley’'s performance of Wasner, the <br id="r2l58">
            
            livery-stable keeper, was thoroughly in the picture. <br id="r2l59">
            
            THE GREEN COCKATOO.“ <br id="r2l60">
            
            The Green Cockatoo is a work of very diffe¬ <br id="r2l61">
            
            rent üibre. It is hardly an exaggeration to describe <br id="r2l62">
            
            it as a masterpiece of its kind. The elements of <br id="r2l63">
            
            humour, observation, dramatic effoct, and sensation¬ <br id="r2l64">
            
            alism are blended in it with the happiest results. <br id="r2l65">
            
            At one moment you are thrilled to the marrow; an <br id="r2l66">
            
            instant later responsive laughter greets the grotesque¬ <br id="r2l67">
            
            ness of the situation. It is the period of the Terror <br id="r2l68">
            
            in Paris. To the Green Cockatoo, an undergwund <br id="r2l69">
            
            tavern kept by Prosper, formerly a theatrical <br id="r2l70">
            
            manager, aristocrats are flocking to enjoy a new <br id="r2l71">
            
            experience. Prosper has engaged a company of <br id="r2l72">
            
            ncedy actors and actresses. Their business is to <br id="r2l73">

            which may or may not have occurred. The place, <br id="r2l75">
            
            for example, is suddenly invaded by a weird figure. <br id="r2l76">
            
            who tells with intense realism how he is flying from <br id="r2l77">
            
            Justice because ho has taken his rival’s life; a man <br id="r2l78">
            
            scizes his wife by the throat and endeavours to <br id="r2l79">
            
            strangle her because she has been unfaithful. The <br id="r2l80">
            
            situation ends in a laugh or a taunt bythe host that <br id="r2l81">
            
            it is not a bit like the real thing. <br id="r2l82">
            
            That comes later in an episode which stirs the <br id="r2l83">
