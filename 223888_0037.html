            At all events, Schnitzler has done his <br id="r2l25">
            
            best to give point to this mot about his <br id="r2l26">

            The German title of the piece, <br id="r2l33">
            
            Traumnovelle,“ gives the key to its <br id="r2l34">

            heat. The provocative character of the <br id="r2l43">
            
            narrative lies in its mystery. Are the <br id="r2l44">
            
            nocturnal adventures of Fridolin actual <br id="r2l45">

            taken on palpability? Is the dream of <br id="r2l47">

            from her. She lay there quietly, with <br id="r3l44">
            
            her arms folded under her head, and <br id="r3l45">
            
            remained silent long after Fridolin had <br id="r3l46">

            lifetime, is not the whole truth.“ <br id="r3l63">
            
            And no dream,“ he said with a <br id="r3l64">
            
            slight sigh, “is entirely a dream.) <br id="r3l65">
            
            That would seem to be the moral of <br id="r3l66">
            
            tnis unadorned tale. It is part of <br id="r3l67">

            woven it into the texture of his fable. <br id="r3l70">
            
            And, though the two statements are <br id="r3l71">
            
            something of a commonplace, he has <br id="r3l72">
