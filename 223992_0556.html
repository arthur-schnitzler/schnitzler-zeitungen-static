            evening —in this room, the lamp between her and me, and she <br id="r2l2">
            
            looking at me with her quiet smile, a smile so resigned as <br id="r2l3">

            having shielded her so well from all temptation—and all happi¬ <br id="r2l6">
            
            ness. Their conversation is interrupted by Mizi, who comes to <br id="r2l7">
            
            fetch Christine, and a fewminutes later Christine herself enters, <br id="r2l8">
            
            looking very tired and depressed. She reassures her anxious <br id="r2l9">
            
            father by saying that it is nothing but a headache, whereupon <br id="r2l10">
            
            he leaves to attend to his orchestral duties at the Opera. Left <br id="r2l11">
            
            alone with Mizi, Christine confides to her that she had gone <br id="r2l12">
            
            out to meet Fritz, but he had not come. While Mizi is trying <br id="r2l13">
            
            to comfort her and convert her to her own opinion on men, <br id="r2l14">
            
            Fritz enters. Christine is delighted, and Mizi leaves the two <br id="r2l15">
            
            alone. Itisthe first time that Fritz has ever entered Christine's <br id="r2l16">
            
            room; everpthing here surrounds him with an air of peace <br id="r2l17">
            
            and love. He feels so happy and at home in hersimple abode, <br id="r2l18">
            
            and nearer and nearer does he feel himself drawn towards <br id="r2l19">
            
            this gentle young heart. But it is not to be: his dream of <br id="r2l20">
            
            love and life is over. To-morrow will lind him a corpse. He <br id="r2l21">
            
            gently tells Christine that he will have to leave town for a <br id="r2l22">
            
            short time to go and see his parents. The girl’s anxious <br id="r2l23">
            
            forebodings he tries to calm. Then the hour of parting <br id="r2l24">
            
            strikes. Theodor comes to fetch Fritz and the lovers part. <br id="r2l25">
            
            Christine is in a fearful state of excitement. Three <br id="r2l26">
            
            ACT III. days have passed and she has not had a word <br id="r2l27">
            
            from Fritz, nor have they seen Theodor since. She entreats <br id="r2l28">
            
            Mizi to go and see if Theodor is back and try to get news <br id="r2l29">
            
            about Fritz. Mizi promises to do it and leaves. Shortly after <br id="r2l30">
            
            Weiring enters. He looks at his child: she does not know <br id="r2l31">
            
            it yet. And gentlv and tenderly he tries to prepare the poor <br id="r2l32">
            
            heart for the terrible blow that is coming. Christine, alarmed <br id="r2l33">
            
            beyond endurance, tries to rush out to find out what it all <br id="r2l34">
            
            means, when Mizi and Theodor enter. Their faces tellthe <br id="r2l35">
            
            poor girl the whole, sad truth. Fritz is dead, killed in a duel <br id="r2l36">
            
            for another woman! Her love is dead and gone and she had <br id="r2l37">
            
            not known it! She entreats Theodor to take her to him to <br id="r2l38">
            
            let her have a last look at his face. It i# too late, he was <br id="r2l39">
            
            buried this very morning! Buried, and she had not been told! <br id="r2l40">
            
            In wild despair she tears herseif away from her father and <br id="r2l41">
            
            rushes out; Theodor and Mizi rush after her. But the heart¬ <br id="r2l42">
            
            broken father feels they will be too late and he falls down <br id="r2l43">
            
            11 <br id="r2l44">
            
            sobbing:“ She won't come back! She won't come back! <br id="r2l45">
