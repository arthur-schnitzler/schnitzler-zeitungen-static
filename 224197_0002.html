            entire lack of preaching in the book, for one of the great virtues of the author <br id="r1l6">
            
            is that he confines himself rigidly to characterization. <br id="r1l7">
            
            Among the acquaintances of Anatol we find the'Sweet Girlie' (Süsze <br id="r1l8">
            
            Mädl), of Viennese life, Sthe suburban girl who loves in the city and marries <br id="r1l9">
            
            in the suburb.' She appears in many of Schnitzler’s works, and has been <br id="r1l10">
            
            depicted with so much cleverness and success that the reader is tempted <br id="r1l11">
            
            to overestimate her importance in the works of the poet. Schnitzler <br id="r1l12">
            
            does not make any type representative of a fixed morality, therefore we find <br id="r1l13">
            
            all shades of virtue and vice in these girls. He has little of Anatol’s patience <br id="r1l14">
            
            for those — many in number — who are not worth consideraticn, but the <br id="r1l15">
            
            major part of his attention is devoted to those whose lives are distorted <br id="r1l16">
            
            by the unfortunate conditions that have grown up in our modern life. <br id="r1l17">
            
            Conventionalism has been too ready to condemn every woman who has <br id="r1l18">
            
            ever taken a false step. The conventional standards have not even acted <br id="r1l19">
            
            as a deterrent to the young girl at the door of womanhood — and the con¬ <br id="r1l20">
            
            fession of good and bad in this connection is one cfthe greatest blots upon <br id="r1l21">
            
            our modern civilization. As a man of science, Schnitzler was naturally <br id="r1l22">
            
            cautious about developing new and binding principles of conduct. His <br id="r1l23">
            
            earlier works, however, show that he was interested deeply in two questions: <br id="r1l24">
            
            the rescuing of those who are worthy of a life of seif-respect, and the sig¬ <br id="r1l25">
            
            nificance of the double standard of ethics for men and women. <br id="r1l26">
            
            Both of these questions enter into the first drama, The Fairy-tale' <br id="r1l27">
            
            (°94). It depicts the tragedy of Fanny Theren, the daughter of a widow, <br id="r1l28">
            
            who has not had the character and intelligence necessary to guide her two <br id="r1l29">
            
            daughters properly. Fanny, during her adolescence, becomes infatuated <br id="r1l30">
            
            with a young man of no self-respect, and becomes his victim. From this <br id="r1l31">
            
            relation she is rescued by a young physician, who becomes her lover, but <br id="r1l32">
            
            later forsakes her for a conventional marriage. She enters the stage where <br id="r1l33">
            
            she has a measure of success. She now makes the acquaintance of Fedor <br id="r1l34">
            
            Denner, who at a reception in her home defends the thesis that a woman <br id="r1l35">
            
            with a past is not necessarily to be condemned. He refers pointedly to <br id="r1l36">
            
            the fairy tale of our prejudices on this topic. This gives Fanny a new self¬ <br id="r1l37">
            
            respect, and inspired by it she rises to real triumphs in her art. But Denner <br id="r1l38">
            
            realizes that Fanny has a past, and in spite of his professions of faith in an <br id="r1l39">
            
            equal standard of morality for men and women. his ardor cools. Repeated <br id="r1l40">
            
            desperate attempts on the part of Fanny to win him back are of no avail. <br id="r1l41">
            
            His feelings completely dominate his convictions. Fanny gives up this last <br id="r1l42">
            
            In contrast with Fanny, <br id="r1l43">
            
            hope and accepts a call to the St. Petersburg stage. <br id="r1l44">
            
            her conventional sister, Klara, becomes a music teacher, and is not beset by <br id="r1l45">
            
            temptations. She marries a good-natured correct official many years her <br id="r1l46">
            
            senior, and settles down to a life of philistinism. <br id="r1l47">
