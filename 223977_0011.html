            How He Lied to Her Husband“ is a <br id="r1l47">
            
            characteristic whimsicality of Mr. George <br id="r1l48">
            
            Bernard Shaw, intended to burlesque the <br id="r1l49">
            
            author’s own play of Candida. Humor¬ <br id="r1l50">
            
            ous enough in conception and treatment, it is <br id="r1l51">
            
            supremely bitter and cynical in lesson. Not <br id="r1l52">
            
            the least disposed are we to censure Mr. <br id="r1l53">
            
            Shaw for being what he is, or writing what <br id="r1l54">
            
            he can write. The lesson that he now## <br id="r1l55">
            
            preaches s taught virtually three hundred <br id="r1l56">
            
            years ago by the Shakespeare he affects to <br id="r1l57">
            
            despise. <br id="r1l58">
            
            Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere <br id="r1l59">
            
            folly. <br id="r1l60">

            spond pretty closely with Eugene and Can¬ <br id="r1l62">
            
            dida in Mr. Shaw’s Candida. He is apoet, <br id="r1l63">
            
            and has dedicated to her many passionate <br id="r1l64">
            
            stanzas with which, though she has not read <br id="r1l65">
            
            them, she is much gratified. Unluckily, she <br id="r1l66">
            
            has allowed an offensive sister-in-law to pur¬ <br id="r1l67">
            
            loin them, and they are now presumably in <br id="r1l68">
            
            the hands of ber husband, whose immediate <br id="r1l69">
            
            coming she anticipates. Spurning the advice <br id="r1l70">
            
            of Apjohn that they shall go to Bumpus, avow <br id="r1l71">
            
            their love, quit his house in company, and <br id="r1l72">
            
            leave him to take wihat steps he will, she <br id="r1l73">
            
            insists that he shall lie tbrough thick and <br id="r1l74">
            
            thin, and declare that the poems, which are <br id="r1l75">
            
            addressed to Aurora, have no personal appli¬ <br id="r1l76">
            
            cation and are only typical of the dawn. <br id="r1l77">
            
            Bumpus arrives, furnished with the poems, <br id="r1l78">
            
            demands an explanation, and is left by the <br id="r1l79">
            
            cowering lady alone with her lover. In fulfil¬ <br id="r1l80">
            
            ment of his promise, Apjohm lies for all he is <br id="r1l81">
            
            worth, but is surprised to find he is on the <br id="r1l82">
            
            wrong tack. Bumpus is mortally offended to <br id="r1l83">
            
            find that his wife is not the object of this <br id="r1l84">
            
            poetical homage, and when, hearng a noise, <br id="r1l85">
            
            Aurora enters the room to allay a deadly <br id="r1l86">
            
            combat, she finds both ien on the floor as <br id="r1l87">
            
            the result of an assault by the husband upon <br id="r1l88">
