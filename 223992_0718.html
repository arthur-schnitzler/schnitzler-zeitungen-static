            has been wasted in musical comedy. <br id="r2l43">
            
            As the outraged husband, Mr. Alfred <br id="r2l44">

            episode of the whole play, and Miss Sarab <br id="r2l47">

            performance of the hero’s friend had many <br id="r2l50">
            
            good points, but as the hero Mr. John Dean's <br id="r2l51">
            
            work was decidedly uneven, In one point <br id="r2l52">
            
            he was successful, however. He made yon <br id="r2l53">
            
            realize that, in spite of all his previous <br id="r2l54">
            
            affairs, his love for Christine is really the <br id="r2l55">
            
            biggest thing in bis life. <br id="r2l56">
            
            Here is the story in a nutshell: Fritz <br id="r2l57">
            
            Sommer, a gay young citizen of Vienna, <br id="r2l58">
            
            (has been carrying on a love affair with <br id="r2l59">
            
            anôther man’s wife. The husband has. <br id="r2l60">
            
            discovered his lové letters, and after a <br id="r2l61">
            
            stormy scène in the young man’s apartments <br id="r2l62">
            
            he challenges him to a duel. After he has <br id="r2l63">
            
            gone Christine, his newest mistress, thei <br id="r2l64">
            
            daughter of an orchestra player in one of <br id="r2l65">
            
            the theatres, comes to his rooms with her <br id="r2l66">
            
            friend Mitzi and Fritz’s friend Theodor. <br id="r2l67">
            
            who is to be his second in the duel. <br id="r2l68">
            
            The first act ends with a jolly little supper <br id="r2l69">
            
            party. The second act is laid in Ohristine's <br id="r2l70">
            
            shabby little home, where Fritz comes to <br id="r2l71">
            
            say goodby to her. The scene in this act <br id="r2l72">
            
            where tbe girl declares her great and abid¬ <br id="r2l73">
            
            ing love for him is one of the most <br id="r2l74">
            
            beautifully written scenes to be found in a. <br id="r2l75">
            
            modern play. Two days later, after the <br id="r2l76">
            
            duel has been fought and Fritg has met his <br id="r2l77">
            
            death, Theodor ccmes to the girl’s apart¬ <br id="r2l78">
            
            ment to break the news to her. <br id="r2l79">
            
            After her first burst of grief the girl de¬ <br id="r2l80">
            
            clares her intention of going to see her <br id="r2l81">
            
            lover’s body. Theodor tells her that he is <br id="r2l82">
            
            already dead. Then she seizes her hat to <br id="r2l83">
            
            go to his grave; but again the young man <br id="r2l84">
            
            stops her with the warning that she will <br id="r2l85">
            
            find another woman praying by his grave. <br id="r2l86">
            
            This scene, as we said before, calls for <br id="r2l87">
            
            tremendous acting. As it is played at the <br id="r2l88">
            
            Berkeley now, with all the best intentions <br id="r2l89">
            
            in the world, it becomes only harassing. <br id="r2l90">
            
            rather than harrowing. <br id="r2l91">
            
            The play is so desperately pessimistio <br id="r2l92">
            
            in all its tendencies that it will never stand <br id="r2l93">
            
            a chance of popularity here, but it is for <br id="r2l94">
            
            allthat a play of remarkablé power, one of <br id="r2l95">
            
            those plays which no real lover of the <br id="r2l96">
            
            theatre can afford to miss, It is as <br id="r2l97">
            
            unusial as it is depressing, and yet ite <br id="r2l98">
            
            theme has been handled with such splendid <br id="r2l99">
            
            skilb and all its characters are so admirably <br id="r2l100">
            
            drawn that it cannot fail to prove interest¬ <br id="r2l101">
            
            ing to those theatregoers who care for <br id="r2l102">
            
            dramas which are quite out of the general <br id="r2l103">
