            MARG.—Clement! (Tries to hold him back.) <br id="r1l53">

            MARG.—But the opinion of an authority was— <br id="r1l58">
            
            left me for good. What shall I do? Clement! Is everything <br id="r1l59">

            MARG.—I call to mind, for instance, an article by Neu¬ <br id="r1l62">
            
            after him. (She looks for her hat. The doorbell rings.) Ah, <br id="r1l63">
            
            mann in the Algemeine'- <br id="r1l64">
            
            he’s coming back. He only wanted to give me a scare. Oh, <br id="r1l65">
            
            GIL.—(Angrily.) Neumann’s a blamed idiot! I boxed his <br id="r1l66">
            
            ears for him once. <br id="r1l67">
            
            my Clement! (Goes to the doro. Gilbert enters.) <br id="r1l68">
            
            MARG.—Vou— <br id="r1l69">
            
            GIL.—(Tothe maid.) I told you so. Madame’s at home. <br id="r1l70">
            
            How do you do, Margaret? <br id="r1l71">
            
            GIL.—In fancy— But you were quite as much wrought <br id="r1l72">
            
            MARG.—(Astonished.) Vou? <br id="r1l73">
            
            up about the business as I at that time. We were perfectly <br id="r1l74">
            
            GIL.—It’s I—I. Amandus Gilbert. <br id="r1l75">
            
            agreed that Neumann was a blamed idiot.“ How can such a <br id="r1l76">
            
            MARG.—I'm so surprised. <br id="r1l77">
            
            numbskull dare'—these were your very words—“to set bounds <br id="r1l78">
            
            GIL.—So I see. There’s no cause for it. I merely thought <br id="r1l79">
            
            to your genius? How can he dare to stifle your nert work <br id="r1l80">
            
            I’d stop over. I'm on my way to Italy, I came to offer you <br id="r1l81">
            
            still, so to speak, in the womb?“ You said that! And today <br id="r1l82">
            
            my latest book for auld lang syne. (Hands her the book. <br id="r1l83">
            
            you quote that literary hawker! <br id="r1l84">
            
            As she does not take it, he places it on ihe table.) <br id="r1l85">

            MARG.—It’s very good of you. Thanks! <br id="r1l87">
            
            GIL.—I don't propose to bother myself about the widows <br id="r1l88">
            
            GIL.—You have a certain proprietorship in that beok. So <br id="r1l89">
            
            of defunct generals when every nerve in my body is a-tingle. <br id="r1l90">
            
            you are living here? <br id="r1l91">
            
            MARG.—What did I say? I can't acconnt for your touhei¬ <br id="r1l92">
            
            MARG.—Ves, but— <br id="r1l93">
            
            ness. <br id="r1l94">
            
            GIL.—Opposite the stadium, I sec. As far as furnished <br id="r1l95">
            
            GIL.—Touchiness! You call me touchy? You! Who used <br id="r1l96">
            
            rooms go, it’s passable enough. But tiese family portraits on <br id="r1l97">
            
            to be seized with a violent fit of trembling every time some <br id="r1l98">
            
            the walls would drive me crazy. <br id="r1l99">
            
            insignificent booby on some trumpery sheet happened to utter <br id="r1l100">
            
            MARG.—My housekeeper’s the widow of a general. <br id="r1l101">
            
            an unfavorable word of criticism. <br id="r1l102">
            
            GIL.—Oh, you needn't apologize. <br id="r1l103">
            
            MARG.—I don't remember one word of unfavorable criti¬ <br id="r1l104">
            
            MARG.—Apologize! Really, the idea never occurred to <br id="r1l105">
            
            cism against me. <br id="r1l106">
            
            me. <br id="r1l107">

            GIL.—It’s wonderful to hark back to it now. <br id="r1l109">
            
            ways chivalrous toward beautiful women? <br id="r1l110">
            
            MARG.—To what? <br id="r1l111">
            
            MARG.—Chivalrous? Do you think my poems were praised <br id="r1l112">
            
            GIL.—Why shouldn't I say it? Tothe small room in Steins¬ <br id="r1l113">
            
            out of chivalry? What about your own estimate— <br id="r1l114">

            GIL.—Mine? I'm not going to retract as much as one <br id="r1l116">
            
            remember, Margaret? <br id="r1l117">
            
            little word. I simply want to remind you that you composed <br id="r1l118">
            
            MARG.—Suppose we drop the familiar. <br id="r1l119">
            
            your sheaf of lovely poems while we were living together. <br id="r1l120">
            
            GIL.—As vou please—as you please. (Pause, ihen suddenly.) <br id="r1l121">
            
            MARG.—And you actually consider yourself worthy of <br id="r1l122">
            
            You acted shamefully, Margaret. <br id="r1l123">

            GIL.—Would you have written them if it weren't for me? <br id="r1l126">
            
            GIL.—Would you much rather that I beat around the bush? <br id="r1l127">
            
            They are addressed to me. <br id="r1l128">
