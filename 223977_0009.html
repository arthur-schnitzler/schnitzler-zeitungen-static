            A TRIPLE BILL AT THE COURT. <br id="r1l4">
            
            MR. BERNARD SHAW'S TRAVESTY OF “CANDIDA.“ <br id="r1l5">
            
            There is, of course, something out of thc way about the Vedrenne¬ <br id="r1l6">
            
            Barker matinee season now running so successfully at the Court <br id="r1l7">
            
            Theatre. It is not as other seasons are. The management obviously, <br id="r1l8">
            
            aims at the production of zuperior drama, something a little more <br id="r1l9">
            
            interesting and stimulating than the jest or earnest of conventional <br id="r1l10">
            
            stage-plays. And so we have had“ John Bull’s Other Island, <br id="r1l11">
            
            and very grateful and comforting it has proved. But there was <br id="r1l12">
            
            something a littie strange abeut that brilliant play. Of course it <br id="r1l13">
            
            was unconventional and new as well as wholly delightful. But on <br id="r1l14">
            
            the top of its subtle perfection was laid a thick coat of broad and <br id="r1l15">
            
            easily understood humour, and a large portion of a public which <br id="r1l16">
            
            finds itself bewildered by subtlety, irritated by unconventionality, <br id="r1l17">
            
            and flummoxed by truth, fought (experto crede) for standing-room <br id="r1l18">
            
            in the pit. Perhaps—we are only guessing—Messrs. Vedrenne <br id="r1l19">
            
            and Barker said to themselves: “ This is most gratifying, but, after <br id="r1l20">
            
            all, we have gone in for novelty and unconventionality, and quite <br id="r1l21">
            
            Philistine sort of people insist on coming to this play. What <br id="r1l22">
            
            shall we try next? <br id="r1l23">
            
            No doubt this fanciful reasoning is baseless and unwarranted. <br id="r1l24">
            
            But some such consultation wouid explain the production at the Court <br id="r1l25">
            
            Theatre of yesterday’s triple bill. For the three plays produced <br id="r1l26">
            
            were new and strange enough. Each in its own fashion was a <br id="r1l27">
            
            “ grotesque''—not using the word in an offensive sense. Mr. <br id="r1l28">
            
            W. B. Veats’s“ The Pot of Broth?' a grotesque of nonsensicality, <br id="r1l29">
            
            Herr Arthur Schnitzler’s “ In the Hospital“’ a grotesque of brutality, <br id="r1l30">
            
            and Mr. Bernard Shaw'’s How He Lied to Her Husband'' a <br id="r1l31">
            
            grotesque of sheer, irresponsible, boisterous fun. Mr. Yeats’s play <br id="r1l32">
            
            has already been seen in London. It is a little countryside legend <br id="r1l33">
            
            (Trish, of couxse) of a beggar who sets his wits to fill his stomach, <br id="r1l34">
            
            and wheedles unbeknownst a dinner out of a foolish woman by a <br id="r1l35">
            
            strange tale of a magic stone which makes broth and stirabout and <br id="r1l36">
            
            poteen out of nothing at all, done into the outward semblance of <br id="r1l37">
            
            a one-act play. It is thin and not very diverting. Its sole <br id="r1l38">
            
            recommendation lies in its being, we suppose, an example of the <br id="r1l39">
            
            work of the Pan-Celtic School. Vesterday it was not played con¬ <br id="r1l40">
            
            spicuously well, and no more necd be said of it. <br id="r1l41">
            
            Herr Schnitzler’s play, translated by Mr. Christopher Horne, is <br id="r1l42">
            
            a thoroughly Teutonic essay in realistic brutalitv. We sec how <br id="r1l43">
            
            horrible the ward of a German hospital is. Two dying men are always <br id="r1l44">
            
            on the stage. One—a consumptive—not Content with coughing and <br id="r1l45">
            
            gulping and looking deathly, goes one better bv imitating—he is an <br id="r1l46">
            
            actor—the death-throes of other patients. The other dies con¬ <br id="r1l47">
            
            tinually—we should guess from angina pectoris. There is a thread <br id="r1l48">
            
            of plot to give an excuse for the horrors in the story of a revenge <br id="r1l49">
            
            planned by the angina patient as a last consolation of the religion <br id="r1l50">
            
            of hate and frustrated hy some nobler instinct at the last moment. <br id="r1l51">
            
            But the story is sufliciently vague and the dying is the thing. The <br id="r1l52">
            
            play is forcible enough in a brutal way. It could be guaranteed to <br id="r1l53">
            
            send persons suffering from the fashionable nervous troubles home <br id="r1l54">
            
            to fits or strokes. It would certainly terrify children, it might <br id="r1l55">
            
            weaken ill-balanced minds, and it ought to disgust sane and healthy <br id="r1l56">
            
            playgoers. As an experiment it may be very well. But it might <br id="r1l57">
            
            have been kept for the private enthusiasms of the Stage Socie'y. <br id="r1l58">
            
            It is to be hoped and expected that it will never find its way into <br id="r1l59">
            
            an ordinary bill. It was admirably played. Mr. J. D. Beveridge <br id="r1l60">
            
            as the angina patient and Mr. George Trollope (vastly different from <br id="r1l61">
            
            the admirable Hodson of“ John Bull’s Other Island'') as the con¬ <br id="r1l62">
            
            sumptive gave powerful and gruesome performances. <br id="r1l63">
            
            Their art <br id="r1l64">
            
            gave the play an extra shudder, and dislike of the play did not <br id="r1l65">
            
            hinder admiration of their acting. <br id="r1l66">
            
            Finally, to take the nasty taste away,“ How He Lied to Her <br id="r1l67">
            
            Husband?' laid the house back in its seats shaking with laughter. <br id="r1l68">
            
            Here was Mr. Bernard Shaw tilting at evernbody and every¬ <br id="r1l69">
            
            thing, making paradoxical fun of the conventional two men and <br id="r1l70">
            
            one woman play, taking pot-shots at himself, at“ Candida,' at <br id="r1l71">
            
            decadent poets, prosperous City men, South Kensington's smart set, <br id="r1l72">
            
            cutting a hundred capers with boisterous enjoyment and filling a <br id="r1l73">
            
            short forty minutes with pungent wit, rollicking humour, and knock¬ <br id="r1l74">
            
            about fun. This was worth all the rest, and no wonder the play <br id="r1l75">
            
            “ caught on in America. It was most justly interpreted by Miss <br id="r1l76">
            
            Gertrude Kingston (charming, gay, and quite in the picture), Mr. <br id="r1l77">
            
            Granville Barker (as a rollicking parody of Eugene in“ Candida), <br id="r1l78">
            
            and Mr. A. G. Poulton (as a typical City man with fantastic notions <br id="r1l79">
            
            of the advantages of marriage). <br id="r1l80">
            
            Dne would certainly like to go <br id="r1l81">
            
            to andther of these matinees-and to come in for the last of the three <br id="r1l82">
            
            plays. <br id="r1l83">
