            VAUDEVILLE, <br id="r4l8">
            
            Some particularly fine acting and some that <br id="r4l9">
            
            was particularly noisy marked the performance <br id="r4l10">
            
            at the Vaudeville Theatre last night, when <br id="r4l11">
            
            Messrs. Norman MeKinnel and Frederick <br id="r4l12">
            
            Whelen presented a double bill that had the <br id="r4l13">
            
            supreme merit of being something off the <br id="r4l14">
            
            beaten track. <br id="r4l15">
            
            The very fine acting came in the first piece, <br id="r4l16">
            
            Between Sunset and Dawn,? by Hermon <br id="r4l17">
            
            Ould—a play in four scenes of life in and <br id="r4l18">
            
            around a“ doss house in South London. <br id="r4l19">
            
            Low life on the stage seldom rings sincerely, <br id="r4l20">
            
            but in this case the crapulous atmosphere of <br id="r4l21">
            
            sordid misery came right across the footlights, <br id="r4l22">
            
            just as it was said once of Sir Arthur Pinero <br id="r4l23">
            
            that lie brought the scent of new-mown hay <br id="r4l24">
            
            into the theatre. The story is really that of <br id="r4l25">
            
            * The Fugitive? translated into miserable <br id="r4l26">
            
            surroundings. Tothe“ doss house,’ which big <br id="r4l27">
            
            Jim Harris looks after at night for his simian <br id="r4l28">
            
            old möther comes Liz Higgins, seeking shelter. <br id="r4l29">
            
            She has run away from Bill Higgins, a <br id="r4l30">
            
            pal“ of Jim, because he knocks her about <br id="r4l31">
            
            and treats her generally in a brutal way. <br id="r4l32">
            
            Jim has never seen Liz Higgins before, <br id="r4l33">
            
            though he has heard about her as being <br id="r4l34">
            
            bit of class. He is a big, slow, lumbering <br id="r4l35">
            
            man who has never had anything to do with <br id="r4l36">
            
            women, but he takes an immediate fancy to <br id="r4l37">
            
            Liz. To him, in her shawl and battered hat, <br id="r4l38">
            
            her face is the sudden revelation of woman. <br id="r4l39">
            
            So that when Higgins comes in furious search <br id="r4l40">
            
            of his wife big Jim knocks him about a bit <br id="r4l41">
            
            for a change. Then when the husband is out <br id="r4l42">
            
            of the way he proposes that they shall live to¬ <br id="r4l43">
            
            gether, and is almost eloquent in his new¬ <br id="r4l44">
            
            found passion. She consents, but the pride <br id="r4l45">
            
            of being a +respectable woman is strong <br id="r4l46">
            
            upon her, and she steals back to Bill Higgins. <br id="r4l47">
            
            That individual, although he wants her back <br id="r4l48">
            
            badly, is inflamed now by jealousy, and she <br id="r4l49">
            
            flies from him again and back to Jim. <br id="r4l50">
            
            SIGNIFICANT ACTING. <br id="r4l51">
            
            It is here that we have a magnificant pfece <br id="r4l52">
            
            si¬ <br id="r4l53">
            
            of acting. They discuss their miserable <br id="r4l54">
            
            tion, and we see that Jim## imm <br id="r4l55">
            
             <br id="r4l56">
            
            ##alowe and distmstfel-that she wen <br id="r4l57">
            
            her husband at all. There have bei <br id="r4l58">
            
            before that Jim is alqueer fellow. Now <br id="r4l59">
            
            thie stress of his first emotion we seem to see <br id="r4l60">
            
            his mind snap. <br id="r4l61">
            
            He realises the miserable <br id="r4l62">
            
            position of the woman, thrown out again by <br id="r4l63">
            
            her drunken brute of a husband, and now sus¬ <br id="r4l64">
            
            pected a little, against his will, by himself, <br id="r4l65">
            
            the man who wanted to pretect her. One can <br id="r4l66">
            
            see the craziness working in his face. There <br id="r4l67">
            
            is ouly one way out with a woman with her <br id="r4l68">
            
            back to the wall, and he supplies it. He picks <br id="r4l69">
            
            up a knife from the table and stabs her as <br id="r4l70">
            
            she gives him his first caress from woman. <br id="r4l71">
            
            Mr. Norman McKinnel was splendid as the <br id="r4l72">
            
            bemused Jim, and Miss May Blayney as Liz <br id="r4l73">
            
            Higgins gave a piece of restrained, perfect <br id="r4l74">
            
            character acting, with every little point made, <br id="r4l75">
            
            such as is rarely seen on the stage. In the <br id="r4l76">
            
            final scene the madness gradually creeping <br id="r4l77">
            
            over Jim's face andthe bewilderment and then <br id="r4l78">
            
            terror over hers were very finely rendered. <br id="r4l79">
            
            Mrs. Ada King as a sort of female Caliban, <br id="r4l80">
            
            keeper of the doss-house,“ and Mr. Edmond <br id="r4l81">
            
            Breon as the cowardly and blustering Bill <br id="r4l82">
            
            Higgins, were both excellent. The piece itself <br id="r4l83">
            
            was very warmly received. It secmed a pity <br id="r4l84">
            
            that the author could find no way out except <br id="r4l85">
            
            the table knife, but that was how poor Jim <br id="r4l86">
            
            saw the situation. In a way, it is too much <br id="r4l87">
            
            to ask us to believe that the situation would <br id="r4l88">
            
            have turnell Jim’s head, but Mr. MeKinnel <br id="r4l89">
            
            certainly realised it on the stage. <br id="r4l90">
            
            The sccond piece was Arthur Schnitzler’s <br id="r4l91">
