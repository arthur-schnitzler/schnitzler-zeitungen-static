            A wonderful translation of the Austrian <br id="r1l11">
            
            play,“ Professor Bernhardi,“ is attracting <br id="r1l12">
            
            large and interested audiences to the Em¬ <br id="r1l13">
            
            bassy Theatre at Swiss Cottage this week. <br id="r1l14">
            
            Ir presents an intriguing problem which <br id="r1l15">
            
            commands attention, despite the fact that <br id="r1l16">
            
            the piay has little action, and is based on <br id="r1l17">
            
            discussion of the right of a doctor to deny <br id="r1l18">
            
            admittance of a priest to a dying patient, <br id="r1l19">
            
            on the ground that his visit will prevent <br id="r1l20">

            proaching end. <br id="r1l22">
            
            Although the doctor’s motive is not actu¬ <br id="r1l23">
            
            ated by any religious feeling, the fact that <br id="r1l24">
            
            he is a Jew arouses racial and political <br id="r1l25">
            
            quarrels ithat have far reaching conse¬ <br id="r1l26">
            
            quences. <br id="r1l27">
            
            The play finds no solution for bridging <br id="r1l28">
            
            the abyss that has been widened by the <br id="r1l29">

            tion that is never long in the background. <br id="r1l32">
            
            The very fine acting of the clever cast <br id="r1l33">
            
            makes the play one that can not readily be <br id="r1l34">

            The appearance of the priest he considers <br id="r1l55">

            sentenced to two months’ imprison¬ <br id="r4l53">
            
            ment. On his release, the controversy <br id="r4l54">
            
            is still raging, the participants being <br id="r4l55">
            
            violent supporters of the doctor’s <br id="r4l56">

            This theme is convincingly and <br id="r4l60">
            
            faithfully discussed by the author, <br id="r4l61">
            
            though the ending is somewhat incon¬ <br id="r4l62">
            
            clusive; but it is a theme of great in¬ <br id="r4l63">
            
            terest and strong dramatic nossibili¬ <br id="r4l64">

            A moving portrayal of Bernhardi is <br id="r4l66">
            
            given by Mr. Abraham Sofaer, but it <br id="r4l67">
            
            is not a faultless portraval. It is <br id="r4l68">
            
            obviously a very thoughtful piece of <br id="r4l69">

            time, there is, if anything, too much <br id="r4l74">
