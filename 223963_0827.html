            Mr. Schnitzler, the physician and Jew, has <br id="r3l21">
            
            written a play about doctors and anti-semit¬ <br id="r3l22">
            
            ism. His hero, Professor Bernhardi, diree¬ <br id="r3l23">
            
            tor of the Elizabeth Institute, made a slight <br id="r3l24">
            
            mistake in tactics, in pursuance of his pro¬ <br id="r3l25">
            
            fessional duties. He had a patient, a wo¬ <br id="r3l26">
            
            man at the point of death, who believed <br id="r3l27">
            
            herself cured and was leaving the world <br id="r3l28">
            
            happily. The nurse, from force of hablt, <br id="r3l29">
            
            had telephoned for the priest. Professor <br id="r3l30">
            
            Bernhardi, feeling that it was his profes¬ <br id="r3l31">
            
            sional duty not to destroy the peace of his <br id="r3l32">
            
            patient’s last hours by disillusioning her, <br id="r3l33">
            
            forbade the priest to enter. It was, to him <br id="r3l34">
            
            at least, a mere matter of professional rou¬ <br id="r3l35">
            
            tine. But because of it he found himself <br id="r3l36">
            
            thrown into the centre of Viennese politics. <br id="r3l37">
            
            For Professor Bernhardi was a Jew. The <br id="r3l38">
            
            anti-semitic party made capital out of the <br id="r3l39">
            
            Incident. The royal patrons withdrew their <br id="r3l40">
            
            support. The patriotic papers charged him <br id="r3l41">
            
            with having refused the consolations of the <br id="r3l42">
            
            Whristian religion to a patlent. The board 1 <br id="r3l43">
            
            of directors, including in its number an <br id="r3l44">
            
            archbishop, resigned in a body. Parliament <br id="r3l45">
            
            instituted a process against the director. <br id="r3l46">
            
            Under pressure of his confrères he withdrew <br id="r3l47">
            
            from the direction of the institute. The <br id="r3l48">
            
            court then sentenced him to two months <br id="r3l49">
            
            imprisonment and took away his medical <br id="r3l50">
            
            license. It is true that his license was re¬ <br id="r3l51">
            
            stored and that the best of his personal <br id="r3l52">
            
            practice remalned with him after his re¬ <br id="r3l53">
            
            lease. But the thing happened, in spite <br id="r3l54">
            
            of the friendship and would-be support of <br id="r3l55">
            
            his superior, the State minister for publie <br id="r3l56">
            
            instruction. <br id="r3l57">
            
            This is a play which seems to be ut¬ <br id="r3l58">
            
            terly undramatic, especially in Mr. <br id="r3l59">
            
            Schnitzler’s handling of the subject, a <br id="r3l60">
            
            play in which everything dramatic (ex¬ <br id="r3l61">
            
            cept the incident with the priest) hap¬ <br id="r3l62">
            
            pens off stage. But the author has <br id="r3l63">
            
            packed its dialogue so full of ideas and <br id="r3l64">
            
            observation, and has drawn his charac¬ <br id="r3l65">
            
            ters so richly and distinctly, that the <br id="r3l66">
            
            performance is fascinating. In partieu¬ <br id="r3l67">
            
            lar, there is the remarkable scene (com¬ <br id="r3l68">
            
            prising a whole act) in which Bernhardi <br id="r3l69">
            
            fights it out with his confrères of the <br id="r3l70">
            
            institute. This scene, which is merely a <br id="r3l71">
            
            formal session of the faculty, carries us <br id="r3l72">
            
            Into the centre of prejudices and argu¬ <br id="r3l73">
            
            ments, showing ideas, dogmas and per¬ <br id="r3l74">
            
            sonalities in continual and subtle con¬ <br id="r3l75">
            
            flict. Its nearest counterpart in modern <br id="r3l76">
            
            drama is the third act of Granville Bar¬ <br id="r3l77">
            
            ker’s“ Waste,“ the cabinet meeting scene <br id="r3l78">
            
            which is to be cut when the play is per¬ <br id="r3l79">
            
            formed in America. It is par excellence <br id="r3l80">
            
            the Vtalky“ sort of drama which play¬ <br id="r3l81">
            
            writing courses teach us to avoid, but <br id="r3l82">
            
            it is thrilling and dramatic throughout. <br id="r3l83">
            
            Possibly Professor Bernhardi“ will <br id="r3l84">
            
            never “go“ in America, because the sub¬ <br id="r3l85">

            Jew’s advancement in the State service <br id="r3l91">
            
            practically and admittedly depends upon <br id="r3l92">
            
            his formal acceptance of the Christian <br id="r3l93">
