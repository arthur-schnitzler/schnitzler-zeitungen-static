            Schnitzler’s Magnificent Drama <br id="r1l10">
            
            A STUDY IN ANTI-SEMITISM <br id="r1l11">
            
            Oulya few weeks ago, this brilliant classic of Schnitzler’s was <br id="r1l12">
            
            presented at the Embassy Theatre. It has now been put on in the <br id="r1l13">
            
            West End at the Phenix Theatre; and even secing it again after <br id="r1l14">
            
            so short an interval, the power and interest ofthe work grip one <br id="r1l15">
            
            afresh. <br id="r1l16">
            
            Apart from the intense interest which holds the attention from start <br id="r1l17">
            
            to finish—the brilliant dialogue and the valnable light which the play <br id="r1l18">
            
            throws upon the psychology of anti-Semitism—the very evenness with <br id="r1l19">
            
            which the anthor holds the seales in the cass of the # rofessor, lends the <br id="r1l20">
            
            story a vivid reality and raises the discn-sion to a plane of immediate <br id="r1l21">
            
            importance. What Schnitzler shows —and it is a depressing thought that <br id="r1l22">
            
            this is as evident to-day as it was when he wrote the play many <br id="r1l23">
            
            years before the War—is that the antipathy to the Jew in its <br id="r1l24">
            
            original primitive form, is only a very little of the whole <br id="r1l25">
            
            trouble. It is the thousand and one interests and occasions for <br id="r1l26">
            
            selfish opportunism which, building upon the brutish base of hate, raise <br id="r1l27">
            
            up the hideous super-structure of anti-Semitism as a political or social or <br id="r1l28">
            
            superstitions erced. Again I must point out that this play in no way <br id="r1l29">
            
            attempts to portray the contlict between the Jewish and Christian attitude <br id="r1l30">
            
            on the purely religions plane. Schnitzler carefully shows us the priest <br id="r1l31">
            
            and the Jewish doctor respecting eachother as twohonest men, separated <br id="r1l32">
            
            by differences of dogma, but both capable of contributing to the good of <br id="r1l33">
            
            mankind. It is the intrusion of the mean, the selfish, the billiously¬ <br id="r1l34">
            
            hating and dishonestly-jealons among men that produces the urge to <br id="r1l35">
            
            persecute the Jew, and raises an incident into a malicions generalisation. <br id="r1l36">
            
            It has been suggested by no less an authority on theatrical matters <br id="r1l37">
            
            than Mr. Sydney Carroil, writing on this great play, that, from his <br id="r1l38">
            
            experience, Christians as a rule are far more interested in plays of a <br id="r1l39">
            
            Jewish problein nature than are Jews theinselves. There may be some <br id="r1l40">
            
            truth in this, truth whlich is by no means a pleasant reflection on Jewish <br id="r1l41">
            
            theatre-goers. But, thank Heaven, it ouly applies to the least admirable <br id="r1l42">
            
            among our Community, and is not unconnected with that ugly symptom <br id="r1l43">
            
            of minority self-consciousness which, misunderstood and not examined <br id="r1l44">
            
            with a sympathetie reference to its causes, may have helped to produce <br id="r1l45">
            
            that popular theorg that the persecuted “generally ask for it.'' Let <br id="r1l46">
            
            us hope that on this occasion the London Jewish Community will give <br id="r1l47">
            
            practical refutation to Mr. Carroll’s suggestion—no one will be more <br id="r1l48">
            
            gratified than that distinguished writer Mmself. <br id="r1l49">
            
            The cast at the Phoenix is largely the same as that at the former <br id="r1l50">
            
            production. Again Abraham Sofaer gives a magnificent performance <br id="r1l51">
            
            as the Professor. It it amusing to hear people blaming the Jewish <br id="r1l52">
            
            doctor’s stubbornness, inerely because he insisted on doing what was. <br id="r1l53">
            
            in his view, unquestionably right. How the force of morality has weakened <br id="r1l54">
            
            since the days of the categorical imperative! Mr. Sofaer suggests a <br id="r1l55">
            
            genuinely Jewish moral determination and the prophetie refusal to com¬ <br id="r1l56">
            
            promise, comtbined with a deep hinnane kindliness whlich sees in man, <br id="r1l57">
            
            physical and sulfering man, not a plav-thing for the gods, but the image <br id="r1l58">
            
            of God Himseif. It is a noble and inspiring performance, inevitably' <br id="r1l59">
            
            winning our syinpathy where we are not too prejudiced. Ronald Adam s <br id="r1l60">
            
            version of the political opportunist is again delightful, wickedly true to <br id="r1l61">
            
            life and oozing the unctuousness of thie fellow. Earle Grey takes the <br id="r1l62">
            
            cold and scheming Ebenwald in a very convineing manner, tie true <br id="r1l63">
            
            obnoxiousness of which, as happens in real life with such persons, rises <br id="r1l64">

            For every one who is not entirely devoid of brains,“ Bernhardi' <br id="r1l67">
            
            presents a real theatre treat—intelligently, exeiting, topically valuablo <br id="r1l68">
            
            and lasting in its impressiveness, For the Jew, it presents a double <br id="r1l69">
