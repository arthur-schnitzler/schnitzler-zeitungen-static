            A Roman Catholic girl is dying. It is <br id="r2l19">
            
            lagreed that nothing can save her; but <br id="r2l20">
            
            she does not know this. A priest has <br id="r2l21">
            
            been sent for and arrives. The Jewish <br id="r2l22">
            
            idoctor refuses to admit the priest onthe <br id="r2l23">
            
            supposition that this would reveal to the <br id="r2l24">
            
            girl that she was going to die and give <br id="r2l25">
            
            ther a“ fright'’ in her last moments. She <br id="r2l26">
            
            kites <br id="r2l27">
            
            “without the consolations of <br id="r2l28">
            
            religion. Did the doctor do right? <br id="r2l29">
            
            This is the problem set by the late <br id="r2l30">
            
            Arthur Schnitzler, the usually facetions <br id="r2l31">
            
            creator of Anatol, in his obviously <br id="r2l32">
            
            Isincere but contentious play,“ Professor <br id="r2l33">
            
            Bernhardi,’ which had an enthusiastic <br id="r2l34">
            
            reception at the Embassy Theatre last <br id="r2l35">
            
            night. <br id="r2l36">
            
            One has to wait to the end to learn <br id="r2l37">
            
            Schnitzler’s ultimate attitude, which is <br id="r2l38">
            
            that the doctor was“ foolish.“ He did <br id="r2l39">
            
            not understand the psychology of a <br id="r2l40">
            
            devout Roman Catholic patient, who <br id="r2l41">
            
            would rejoice to see a priest in any <br id="r2l42">
            
            circumstances, whatever his coming <br id="r2l43">
            
            might be taken to mean. There have been <br id="r2l44">
            
            cases, indeed, in which lives have been <br id="r2l45">
            
            saved by this. <br id="r2l46">
            
            In between, Schnitzler, who was him¬ <br id="r2l47">
            
            self a Jewish doctor, quite naturally <br id="r2l48">
            
            makes Bernhardi (Mr. Abraham Sofaer), <br id="r2l49">
            
            the doctor in the case, an out-and-out <br id="r2l50">
            
            hero, who is sent to prison for what <br id="r2l51">
            
            seems to have been regarded in Austria <br id="r2l52">
            
            as a crime. <br id="r2l53">
            
            DELIGHTFUL LAST ACT <br id="r2l54">
            
            There are times when this point of <br id="r2l55">
            
            view does not prove entirely convincing <br id="r2l56">
            
            —especially as we see nothing of the girl <br id="r2l57">
            
            herself and have no chance of knowing <br id="r2l58">
            
            what her all-important wishes would <br id="r2l59">
            
            have been. But in a delightful last act <br id="r2l60">
            
            Schnitzler, the agreeable satirist, comes <br id="r2l61">
            
            to the rescue of Schnitzler, the Jewish <br id="r2l62">
            
            propagandist, and we finish in friendly <br id="r2l63">
            
            fashion. <br id="r2l64">
            
            From either standpoint the play is at <br id="r2l65">
            
            least challenging and admirably acted. <br id="r2l66">
            
            Mr. Sofaer’s performance as Berhardi <br id="r2l67">
            
            makes one feel that he would be exactly <br id="r2l68">
            
            the man for a really good play about St. <br id="r2l69">
            
            Paul. His dignity, intelligence, and sym¬ <br id="r2l70">
            
            pathetic candour were beyond cavil. Mr. <br id="r2l71">
            
            Ronald Adam puts in a happy little per¬ <br id="r2l72">
            
            formance as the Minister of Education, <br id="r2l73">
            
            with Mr. Bernard Merefield, excellent <br id="r2l74">
            
            also, as the priest. <br id="r2l75">
