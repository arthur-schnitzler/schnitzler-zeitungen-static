            A man there was, tho’ some did count him mad, <br id="r2l13">
            
            The more he cast away the more he had.? <br id="r2l14">
            
            Doctor Graesler, the genteel physician of small watering-places, <br id="r2l15">
            
            never had much to cast away in the first place, and after he has <br id="r2l16">
            
            cast away that which he had to the extent of some hundred¬ <br id="r2l17">
            
            seventy-five delicately executed pages, he is completely plucked. <br id="r2l18">
            
            It is partly the fault of temperament, but the real villain of <br id="r2l19">
            
            Schnitzler’s story is the subtle and sorry fortieth year. This is <br id="r2l20">
            
            not the first time that Schnitzler has essayed the tragedy of <br id="r2l21">
            
            senescence, of reluctantly turning forty, but in this short novel <br id="r2l22">
            
            he has not to deal with an aging Chevalier de Seingalt, the very <br id="r2l23">
            
            name and evocation of whom supplied a certain pictorial and at¬ <br id="r2l24">
            
            mospheric advantage to Casanova’s Homecoming. Doctor Graesler <br id="r2l25">
            
            is just a timid, quickly used-up Don Juan who, at the outset of <br id="r2l26">
            
            the story, lies comfortably enough between the two stools of his <br id="r2l27">
            
            work, done ardently for its own sake, and a furtive, only half¬ <br id="r2l28">
            
            enjoyed pleasure, consisting mainly of memories. On the surface, <br id="r2l29">
            
            he is as dull and drab as any one of lbsen’s none the less internally <br id="r2l30">
            
            exciting creations; the atmosphere of the story, apart from the <br id="r2l31">
            
            overtones it completely lacks, is the atmosphere of lbsen. The <br id="r2l32">
            
            doctor is the archetype of honest, self-respecting, dignified medi¬ <br id="r2l33">
