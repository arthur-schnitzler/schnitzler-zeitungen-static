            story of a dosshouse is sordid, dull and <br id="r1l22">
            
            depressing, and the final sceie, in which Mr. <br id="r1l23">

            THE GREEN COCKATOO.“ <br id="r3l8">
            
            The new programme at the Vaudeville Theatre <br id="r3l9">
            
            begins with a set of songs composed by Mr. Anton <br id="r3l10">
            
            Dressler and sung mainly by Miss Gertrude Rolffs, <br id="r3l11">
            
            while the composer accompanies and occasionally <br id="r3l12">
            
            sings. The theatre is quite tho place for Mr. Dressler’s <br id="r3l13">
            
            songs, for both the music and the mnanner of singing <br id="r3l14">
            
            aim chiefly at the dramatic. And very dramatic, <br id="r3l15">
            
            and signilicant, and neatly sly the songs become <br id="r3l16">
            
            when Mr. Dresslor is playing and Miss Rolffs is sing¬ <br id="r3l17">
            
            ing with vivacity and polished art. <br id="r3l18">
            
            Next comes a play in four scenes, Bel#cen Sunset <br id="r3l19">
            
            and Daien, written by Mr. Hermon Ould. It is a <br id="r3l20">
            
            play dealing with the sordidest kind of what is com¬ <br id="r3l21">
            
            monly called“ low life,“ and to the facts of that life <br id="r3l22">
            
            it may very likely be true; but that life is in itself <br id="r3l23">
            
            no more interesting than any other kind of <br id="r3l24">
            
            life, and a play which treate of it with elaborate <br id="r3l25">
            
            artifice and ne art has no claims to distinction because <br id="r3l26">
            
            of its subject. But such defects do not matter much, <br id="r3l27">
            
            by comparison with another and a very grave cause <br id="r3l28">
            
            of complaint—the introduction into the play of an <br id="r3l29">
            
            crotomaniac, who in“ making love“ to a woman <br id="r3l30">
            
            stabs her in the back and gibbers over her corpse. <br id="r3l31">
            
            The episode is nothing but disgusting, and should <br id="r3l32">
            
            never have been allowed to appear on the stage of a# <br id="r3l33">
            
            respectable and well-conducted theatre. <br id="r3l34">
            
            The last item in the programme is Arthur <br id="r3l35">
            
            Schnitzler’s play The Green Cockatoo, which was ## <br id="r3l36">
            
            introduced to the English theatre by the Stage <br id="r3l37">
            
            Society some six months ago. It remains exception¬ <br id="r3l38">
            
            ally thrilling, even to those who know the truth of <br id="r3l39">
            
            it, so to speak, from the start. In this underground <br id="r3l40">
            
            tavern of Paris, where the nobles of 1789 come in <br id="r3l41">
            
            all their splendour by night to see the rabble—much <br id="r3l42">
            
            as a modern tourist goes to the Bowery or certain <br id="r3l43">
            
            districts of Chicago—is it all real or make¬ <br id="r3l44">
            
            believe? Prosper, who, like a tavern-keeper in <br id="r3l45">
            
            Montmartre of more recent years, grects his aristo¬ <br id="r3l46">
            
            cratie guests with hideous revilings—does he mean <br id="r3l47">
            
            them, or not? We know that criminals whom he <br id="r3l48">
            
            keeps on show are all shams, jast tavern-players <br id="r3l49">
            
            practised in their parts, because when a real murderer <br id="r3l50">
            
            comes and tells a true story he is cried down as a <br id="r3l51">
            
            poor“ turn,? a mere amateur. That din in the <br id="r3l52">
            
            streets on this night of July 14, that, of course, is <br id="r3l53">
            
            only the rabble making its usual uproar; and, just <br id="r3l54">
            
            imagine! they are said to be storming the Bastille. <br id="r3l55">
            
            But this weird and horrible tale told by the leading <br id="r3l56">
            
            actor, Henry—how he has just caught his newly¬ <br id="r3l57">
            
            wed and adored wife Léocadie with the Duc de <br id="r3l58">

            Vor just another“ turn?' put on for the amusemen! <br id="r3l60">
            
            of the company? And this fearful inrush of s <br id="r3l61">
            
            rufflans, mad with drink and rage <br id="r3l62">
            
            has Prosper surpassed himself #eenin <br id="r3l63">
            
            can it be indeed that the Bas <br id="r3l64">
            
            The play is like a tower that <br id="r3l65">
            
            that, while the suspense of th. <br id="r3l66">
            
            ever more fearful, unt <br id="r3l67">
            
            ruin. <br id="r3l68">
            
            The skill with <br id="r3l69">
            
            has done the dilfleult work of translatie <br id="r3l70">
            
            nized on the play’s first appearance. Bu <br id="r3l71">
            
            respects the perfermance at the Vandevilie is not <br id="r3l72">
            
            equal to that given under Mr. Norman Page for the <br id="r3l73">
            
            Stage Society. The stage of the Vaudeville is too <br id="r3l74">
            
            small for the full effect, and there was last night a <br id="r3l75">
            
            slowness and heaviness about the playing as a whole <br id="r3l76">
            
            which do not sult the brilliant, vivid piece. Mr. <br id="r3l77">
            
            Norman MeKinnel played with all his force as Henry, <br id="r3l78">
            
            and Miss Sarah Brocke made an elegant aristocrat: <br id="r3l79">
            
            but the acting as a whole needed brightening and <br id="r3l80">
