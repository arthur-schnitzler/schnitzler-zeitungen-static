            Schlager, a smart young milliner, merry, light-hearted and <br id="r1l3">
            
            good-natured, soon to be followed by-Christine. There follows <br id="r1l4">
            
            a delightful hour, Theodor and Mizi doing their best to cheer <br id="r1l5">
            
            up Fritz and Christine. For Christine is sad; she is deepli <br id="r1l6">
            
            in love with Fritz, and therefore feels that his love of her is <br id="r1l7">
            
            not what she wishes it to be; he dees not come to sce her as <br id="r1l8">
            
            often as she should wish; moreover, she has seen him at the <br id="r1l9">
            
            Opera the other day in companv of a lady to whom he was <br id="r1l10">
            
            paying marked attentions, and her jealousy is roused. Vet <br id="r1l11">
            
            so irresistible is the merry mood ofthe others that both Fritz <br id="r1l12">
            
            and Christine cannot help joining in. After supper, while <br id="r1l13">
            
            music and dancing are going on, the general merriment is <br id="r1l14">
            
            suddenly interrupted by a bell. Fritz asks the girls and his <br id="r1l15">
            
            friend to wait in the adjoining room, while he himself goes to <br id="r1l16">
            
            open the door to the husband of his mit ress. Not many <br id="r1l17">
            
            words are exchanged; the wronged husbar! returns the <br id="r1l18">
            
            letters to his wife and brings the challenge to a duel. Now <br id="r1l19">
            
            all is lost. When the visitor has left Fritz calls in Theodor <br id="r1l20">
            
            and explains to him in a few hurried words who his visitor <br id="r1l21">
            
            was; the duel is to take place in two days. Theodor is the <br id="r1l22">
            
            self-same night to go and find out another friend who is to <br id="r1l23">
            
            act as second. Theodor tries to make light of the affair, but <br id="r1l24">
            
            Fritz knows that in two days he will be a dead man. Then <br id="r1l25">
            
            the girls are called in; of course they are kept in ignorance <br id="r1l26">
            
            asto what has occurred, and the happy evening is continued <br id="r1l27">
            
            until the time has come to leave. <br id="r1l28">
            
            Christine's room. Christine, who is on the point <br id="r1l29">
            
            ACT II. of going out, is detained by Catherine Binder a, <br id="r1l30">
            
            neighbouring hosier’s wife, who comes to ask her to go out <br id="r1l31">
            
            with them in the evening, but the girl refuses, for she knows <br id="r1l32">
            
            quite well that Catherine’s cousin will be of the party, and <br id="r1l33">
            
            the young man being very much in love with her Christine <br id="r1l34">
            
            does not wish to encourage his advances. Their conver¬ <br id="r1l35">
            
            sation is interrupted by old Weiring; his kindly face is <br id="r1l36">
            
            beaming on his daughter while he hands her a spray of lilac and <br id="r1l37">
            
            urges her to go out into the wonderful spring air. Christine <br id="r1l38">
            
            leaves, glad to be able to get off. Her father’s eyes follon¬ <br id="r1l39">
            
            her tenderly; though his child has not breathed a word to him <br id="r1l40">
            
            he knows her secret and gladly allows her to live her dream <br id="r1l41">
            
            of love. Andto Mrs. Binder’s spiteful remark whether it is <br id="r1l42">
            
            wiseto let a pretty young girlgo her own ways, unguarded, he <br id="r1l43">
            
            simply answers by describing to her his late sister, whom he <br id="r1l44">
            
            had carefully guarded from all temptation: "1 still see her <br id="r1l45">
            
            before me—how often she used to sit opposite me in the <br id="r1l46">
            
            evening—in this room, the lamp between her and me, and she <br id="r2l1">
            
            looking at me with her quiet smile, a smile so resigned as <br id="r2l2">
            
            though she wishedtothank me for something, and 1—I would <br id="r2l3">
            
            tain have thrown myself at her feettoask her to forgive me for <br id="r2l4">
            
            having shielded her so well from all temptation—and all happi¬ <br id="r2l5">
            
            ness. Their conversation is interrupted by Mizi, who comes to <br id="r2l6">
            
            tetch Christine, and a fewminutes later Christine herself enters, <br id="r2l7">
            
            looking very tired and depressed. She reassures her anxious <br id="r2l8">
            
            father by saying that it is nothing but a headache, whereupon <br id="r2l9">
            
            he leaves to attend to his orchestral duties at the Opera. Left <br id="r2l10">
            
            alone with Mizi, Christine confides to her that she had gone <br id="r2l11">
            
            out to meet Fritz, but he had not come. While Mizi is trying <br id="r2l12">
            
            to comfort her and convert her to her own opinion on men, <br id="r2l13">
            
            Fritz enters. Christine is delighted, and Mizi leaves the two <br id="r2l14">
            
            alone. Itis the first time that Fritz has ever entered Christine’s <br id="r2l15">
            
            room; everything here surrounds him with an air of peace <br id="r2l16">
            
            and love. He feels so happy and at home in her simple abode, <br id="r2l17">
            
            and nearer and nearer does he feel himself drawn towards <br id="r2l18">
            
            this gentle young heart. But it is not to be: his dream of <br id="r2l19">
            
            love and life is over. To-morrow will find him a corpse. He <br id="r2l20">
            
            gently tells Christine that he will have to leave town for a <br id="r2l21">
            
            short time to go and see his parents. The girl’s anxious <br id="r2l22">
            
            forebodings he tries to calm. Then the hour of parting <br id="r2l23">
            
            strikes. Theodor comes to fetch Fritz and the lovers part. <br id="r2l24">
            
            Christine is in a fearful state of excitement. Three <br id="r2l25">
            
            ACT III. days have passed and she has not had a word <br id="r2l26">
            
            from Fritz, nor have they seen Theodor since. She entreats <br id="r2l27">
            
            Mizi to go and see if Theodor is back and try to get news <br id="r2l28">
            
            about Fritz. Mizi promises to do it and leaves. Shortly aster <br id="r2l29">
            
            Weiring enters. He looks at his child: she does not know <br id="r2l30">
            
            it yet. And gently and tenderly he tries to prepare the poor <br id="r2l31">
            
            heart for the terrible blow that is coming. Christine, alarmed <br id="r2l32">
            
            beyond endurance, tries to rush out to find out what it all <br id="r2l33">
            
            means, when Mizi and Theodor enter. Their faces tellthe <br id="r2l34">
            
            poor girlthe whole, sad truth. Fritz is dend, killed in a duel <br id="r2l35">
            
            for another woman! Her love is dend and gone and she had <br id="r2l36">
            
            not known it! She entreats Theodorto take her to him to <br id="r2l37">
            
            let her have a last look at his face. It is too late, he was <br id="r2l38">
            
            buried this very morning! Buried, and she had not been told! <br id="r2l39">
            
            In wild despair she tears herself away from her father and <br id="r2l40">
            
            rushes out; Theodor and Mizi rush after her. Butthe heart¬ <br id="r2l41">
            
            broken father feels they will be too late and he falls down <br id="r2l42">
            
            sobbing:" She won't come back! She won't come back!“ <br id="r2l43">
