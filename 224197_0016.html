            and henceforth refuses to take any interest whatsoever in him. She lives <br id="r1l6">
            
            in retirement for years. After his family affairs have been adjusted, Egon <br id="r1l7">
            
            proposes to Mizzi repeatedly, but she always refuses him. When his son <br id="r1l8">
            
            is eighteen years old he adopts him and presents him to Count Arpad. <br id="r1l9">
            
            On this occasion Mizzi is forced to see him and is finally reconciled with <br id="r1l10">
            
            the idea of a marriage with Egon. On the same day Lolo, who has fallen in <br id="r1l11">
            
            love with a dashing transfer man, takes it into her head to make a farewell <br id="r1l12">
            
            visit to Count Arpad. It is a unique 'family reunion.' The various <br id="r1l13">
            
            members of this family have been playing at the farce of correct conven¬ <br id="r1l14">
            
            tionality. For a moment they give vent to their natural feelings and see <br id="r1l15">
            
            each other in something like their true relationship. <br id="r1l16">
            
            The publication of Young Medardus' (’10) indicates that the poet is <br id="r1l17">
            
            being attracted to subjects of a larger scope. The drama presents a picture <br id="r1l18">
            
            of Vienna in the days of Napoleon. Franziska Klähr is the widow of a <br id="r1l19">
            
            bookdealer, who has met an inglorious death as an oflicer in the Australian <br id="r1l20">
            
            army. She has a son, Medardus, who likewise becomes an officer, and the <br id="r1l21">
            
            mother hopes that he may bear arms with better results in the impending <br id="r1l22">
            
            clash with Napoleon. Her daughter, Agathe, is in love with Francois, <br id="r1l23">
            
            the son of the Duke of Valois, a blind old refugee in Vienna, who for years <br id="r1l24">
            
            has fostered the empty hope of winning the French crown. Since the duke <br id="r1l25">
            
            will not consent to a marriage, Mrs. Klähr does not allow Francois to come <br id="r1l26">
            
            to her house, but the two young people meet secretly. On the evening <br id="r1l27">
            
            when Medardus is to leave for the war, Francois appears with the news that <br id="r1l28">
            
            his father’s consent has been promised. This is a false pretext to gain <br id="r1l29">
            
            admission to the house. He has learned that the matter is hopeless and the <br id="r1l30">
            
            two commit suicide together. At his sister’s grave Medardus sees Helene, <br id="r1l31">
            
            the sister of Francois, and vows vengeance upon her family. Intending <br id="r1l32">
            
            to publish her shame from the housetops, he wins her love, but this relation <br id="r1l33">
            
            becomes a pitfall, since his emotions so dominate him that he forgets his <br id="r1l34">
            
            vows of vengeance. After the fall of Vienna, Helene plans to murder Na¬ <br id="r1l35">
            
            poleon by coming to him as a mistress. Quite ignorant of her plan, Me¬ <br id="r1l36">
            
            dardus has also dreamed of murdering the oppressor of his country and thus <br id="r1l37">
            
            wipe out the humiliation which he feels on account of his unmanly conduct. <br id="r1l38">
            
            Just as he sees a chance of carrying out his plan, he secs Helene on her way <br id="r1l39">
            
            to Napoleon and kills her. He is imprisoned, but Napoleon offers him his <br id="r1l40">
            
            liberty because he looks upon him as a tool in the hands of divine Providence, <br id="r1l41">
            
            blindly at work for his protection. Medardus insists upon telling the truth. <br id="r1l42">
            
            He refuses clemency, and by insisting upon his execution, blots out theshame <br id="r1l43">
            
            of the inglorious death of his father. This plot is an insignificant part of <br id="r1l44">
            
            the two hundred and ninety pages of this remarkable book. Like Haupt¬ <br id="r1l45">
