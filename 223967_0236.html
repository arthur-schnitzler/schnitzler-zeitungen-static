            the daughter, who is delighted with her, regrets that <br id="r1l22">
            
            her father should have been so old-fashioned as to <br id="r1l23">
            
            have kept them all these years apart. The father <br id="r1l24">
            
            politely regrets, not without a passing gracc of senti¬ <br id="r1l25">
            
            ment, his mistress’s marriage, but as a man of the <br id="r1l26">
            
            world will not stand in her way. This polite Count <br id="r1l27">
            
            has for friend a no less polite Prince, who intro¬ <br id="r1l28">
            
            duces his son—a natural son, but to be adopted <br id="r1l29">
            
            and to take the Prince’s name, and quite a nice <br id="r1l30">
            
            boy. The nice boy wonders who his mother is, <br id="r1l31">
            
            and thinks it may be the Count’s mistress; but he <br id="r1l32">
            
            has guessed wrong—it is the daughter. It is not <br id="r1l33">
            
            quite clear why Countess Mizzi did not marry the <br id="r1l34">
            
            Prince (as soon, that is to say, as his wife was dead); <br id="r1l35">
            
            he repeatedly made the offer, but was refused and <br id="r1l36">
            
            had“to console himself“ elsewhere. Indeed, they <br id="r1l37">
            
            have both consoled themselves, and with a varied <br id="r1l38">
            
            assortment of liaisons. (“ You know I, too, have <br id="r1l39">
            
            had my fling,' says Mizzi to the other lady, who <br id="r1l40">
            
            replies effusively,“ Oh, I’i so glad.*) Ner has Mizzi <br id="r1l41">
            
            seen her son from his birth until to-day. Of course <br id="r1l42">
            
            vou will not expect from her any conventional <br id="r1l43">
            
            nonsense about the cry of the blood. She simply, <br id="r1l44">
            
            like any stranger, thinks the boy quite s nice hoy. <br id="r1l45">
            
            And as she is rather tired of her varions“ consola¬ <br id="r1l46">
            
            tions“ (you see her politely giving one of them, <br id="r1l47">
            
            presumably the latest, his congé), and the Prince <br id="r1l48">
            
            once more offers marriage, and the boy, her son, <br id="r1l49">
            
            Iturns out to be so nice a boy, and her father’s mistress <br id="r1l50">
            
            is now to be happily married, and it is a fine day <br id="r1l51">
            
            and she feels in a good humour—why, let them <br id="r1l52">
            
            all go off to Ostend together, where (if she <br id="r1l53">
            
            docsn't change her mind again) you guess that <br id="r1l54">
            
            she will consent at last to accept her son’s father <br id="r1l55">
            
            for her husband. You guess also that the boy, who <br id="r1l56">
            
            is as sharp as he is nice, will soon know who his <br id="r1l57">
            
            mother is. The only person who will remain in the <br id="r1l58">
            
            dark will be the Count, who is clearly too simple <br id="r1l59">
            
            and old-fashioned to be told. And you must admit <br id="r1l60">
            
            that, while the morals of the party are a trifle— <br id="r1l61">
            
            what shall we say ?—unveiled, their manners, all <br id="r1l62">
            
            round, are extremely elegant. In fact, it has evi¬ <br id="r1l63">
            
            dently been Herr Schnitzler’s intention to present <br id="r1l64">
            
            them all as eminently“ sympathetic persons. Well, <br id="r1l65">
            
            vou must remember, it all happens in (or near) <br id="r1l66">
            
            Vienna, and perhaps it isn't truc. <br id="r1l67">
            
            After that, another Schnitzler, translated by Miss <br id="r1l68">
            
            (or Mrs.) Penclope Wheeler, The Green Cockatoo, <br id="r1l69">
            
            which shows what was going on in an underground <br id="r1l70">
            
            Paris tavern on the evening they were taking the <br id="r1l71">
            
            Bastille overhead. Hither came jaded aristocrats in <br id="r1l72">
            
            search of a new thrill, and found it in watching <br id="r1l73">
            
            broken-down actors pretending to be criminals of <br id="r1l74">
            
            the deepest dye. A real eriminal who had got into <br id="r1l75">
            
            the place by accident would have told them how <br id="r1l76">
            
            he murdered his aunt, but was soon silenced as a <br id="r1l77">
            
            hopeless amateur. This comic contrast of reality <br id="r1l78">
            
            Pand pretence was, however, soon followed by a <br id="r1l79">
            
            tragie one. The“ star of the company, newly <br id="r1l80">
            
            married, acts with great force the part of a revenging <br id="r1l81">
            
            husband; he pretends to have just come from killing <br id="r1l82">
            
            1a certain Duke in bis wife’s dressing-room. So real¬ <br id="r1l83">
            
            istic is his acting thateven his comrades are deceived, <br id="r1l84">
            
            and appland him for having taken just vengeance <br id="r1l85">
            
            Von the man who was (in very truth) his wife’s lover. <br id="r1l86">
            
            At this moment the Duke enters the tavern, and the <br id="r1l87">
            
            Tactor knifes him. The aristocratie crowd, affrighted, <br id="r1l88">
            
            Frushes out, and from above the populace, having <br id="r1l89">
            
            taken the Bastille, swarm in; so ends this nerve¬ <br id="r1l90">
            
            shaking study in the marabre. It gave fine oppor¬ <br id="r1l91">
            
            tunities to both Mr. Norman Page, who murdered <br id="r1l92">
            
            his aunt, and Mr. Leon Quartermaine, who murdered <br id="r1l93">
            
            the Duke. Certainly the Stage Societz epicures <br id="r1l94">

            AFTERNOON WITH SCHNITZLER. <br id="r2l8">
            
            To the ordinary English playgoer the name of <br id="r2l9">
            
            Arthur Schnitzler is mainly familiar by reason of <br id="r2l10">
            
            his Anatol sketches, translated and produced by <br id="r2l11">
            
            Mr. Granville Barker. Yesterday, at a partionlarly <br id="r2l12">
            
            interestung matinóe given at the Aldwych by the <br id="r2l13">
            
            Incorporuted Stage Society, we had the privilege of <br id="r2l14">
            
            making his better acquaintance. The two one-act <br id="r2l15">
            
            pieces presented served admirably to emphasise the <br id="r2l16">
            
            scope of his peculiar talent. Comtesse Mizzi is <br id="r2l17">
            
            quite in the vein of Anktol. It is hoavily <br id="r2l18">
            
            charged—overcharged, some might insist—with <br id="r2l19">
            
            cynicism; it provides, with a light-heartednces that <br id="r2l20">
            
            almost appals, an extraordinary study of the baser <br id="r2l21">
            
            aspects of social life. The characters are more or <br id="r2l22">
            
            lees tarred with the same brush; they are entirely <br id="r2l23">
            
            unmoral and frankly bosstful of the fact. One might <br id="r2l24">
            
            speak of them as degenerates, wore it not that they <br id="r2l25">
            
            take such a healthy prido in their own misdoings. <br id="r2l26">
            
            You have, for instance, Prince Ravenstein, who has <br id="r2l27">
            
            sedured the daughter of his friend, Count Pazmandy, <br id="r2l28">
            
            the Countess Mizzi. The result of their intrigue is a <br id="r2l29">
            
            son, Philip whom his mother has not even cared to <br id="r2l30">
            
            recogmise, and who, although littie more than a youth, <br id="r2l31">
