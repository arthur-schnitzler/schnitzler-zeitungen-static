            no missionary by nature. The passion for proselytism <br id="r1l11">

            is alien to my temperament; and so is the passion for <br id="r1l13">
            
            he wish to foster such a hunger in others. Therefore, <br id="r1l14">
            
            adventure. Besides, 1 am not at all certain that, even <br id="r1l15">

            blemishes under which his character may labour are <br id="r1l22">

            that the concern is at least a hopeful one. At my time of <br id="r1l27">

            that I have much energyto spare; in fact, I find it little <br id="r1l31">

            enough for the intellectual labours I have on my hands, <br id="r1l33">
            
            above all, he does not venture to insult the wickedness <br id="r1l34">
            
            and therefore let no critic expect to frighten me bya few <br id="r1l35">
            
            of his neighbours by parading his own feeble essays in <br id="r1l36">
            
            hard words into embarking any part of it upon desperate <br id="r1l37">

            adventures of altruistic morality. <br id="r1l39">
            
            This frank admission may perhaps act as a warning <br id="r1l40">
            
            For the rest, my work, like its author’s life, although <br id="r1l41">

            so-called “ human documents.? But, in truth, such <br id="r1l44">
            
            a plan. So much so that many a reader, while perusing <br id="r1l45">
            
            readers the Don does not desire. His discourses are, <br id="r1l46">
            
            my divagations, in this or some future age, may well ask <br id="r1l47">
            
            as Pindar would have said if he could see them, B4y <br id="r1l48">

            addressed to superior persons, iconoclasts, and all true <br id="r1l52">
            
            answer can ever be vouchsafed. Suflice it to state, in <br id="r1l53">
            
            unbelievers—that is to say, to those individuals who are <br id="r1l54">
