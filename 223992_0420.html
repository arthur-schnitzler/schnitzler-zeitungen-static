            opportunity of seeing her Carmen <br id="r2l50">
            
            again for some time, so that to the <br id="r2l51">

            siastic audience present last night the <br id="r2l53">
            
            performance partock much of the nature <br id="r2l54">
            
            of a farewell. <br id="r2l55">
            
            To my thinking, Calve’s Carmen is <br id="r2l56">
            
            never so artistic as when she is sup¬ <br id="r2l57">
            
            ported by Jean de Reszke as Don Jose. <br id="r2l58">
            
            And this without any reflection on the <br id="r2l59">
            
            artistic capacity of Salignac, who is <br id="r2l60">
            
            really excellent in the role, and whc <br id="r2l61">
            
            sang better last night—especially the <br id="r2l62">
            
            Flower Song’'—than I have ever heard <br id="r2l63">
            
            him. <br id="r2l64">
            
            Calve was in good volce, but was at <br id="r2l65">
            
            times à littie inc.ined to be careless, and <br id="r2l66">
            
            was certainlv most kittenish in manner <br id="r2l67">
            
            and action. Calve should remember that <br id="r2l68">
            
            a lack of artistie restraint and conti¬ <br id="r2l69">
            
            nence may serlously impair even th <br id="r2l70">
            
            most artistie, finished and considered <br id="r2l71">
            
            impersonation. But even if she dees <br id="r2l72">
            
            overact a little occasionally one cannot <br id="r2l73">
            
            but acclaim the skill with which Calve <br id="r2l74">
            
            suggests without coarseness the real <br id="r2l75">
            
            Carmen. Her Carmen is, indeed, no <br id="r2l76">
            
            saint, but, as compared with Miss Neth¬ <br id="r2l77">
            
            versole's, it is an angel of light. <br id="r2l78">
            
            Lasalle sang the Toreador song much <br id="r2l79">
            
            better than usual, possibly because—1f <br id="r2l80">
            
            my ear did not deceive me—he trans¬ <br id="r2l81">
            
            posed it a tone lower. The rest of the <br id="r2l82">
            
            cast was as usual, except that Mme. De <br id="r2l83">
            
            Vere sang the role of Michaela and sang <br id="r2l84">
            
            it very prettily indeed; the aria being <br id="r2l85">
            
            given with so much taste and feeling <br id="r2l86">
            
            that it was redemanded. <br id="r2l87">
            
            The performance on the whole was an <br id="r2l88">
            
            excellent one and fully up to the usual <br id="r2l89">

            Agnes Sorma presented a new play at <br id="r3l75">
            
            the Irving Place Theatre last evening. <br id="r3l76">

            The play is a rather remarkable one in <br id="r3l80">
            
            its straightforward, realistic and concise <br id="r3l81">

            The author presents his story. simply <br id="r3l90">
            
            and naturally. He does not discuss the <br id="r3l91">
            
            problem, he does not seek to explain the <br id="r3l92">
            
            great mystery; he makes no attempt 'to <br id="r3l93">
            
            teach a lesson or. draw a moral. He <br id="r3l94">
            
            allows the audience’s imagination to do <br id="r3l95">
            
            all this. In his construction and develop¬ <br id="r3l96">

            atricism and adheres rigidiy to realigtic <br id="r3l98">
            
            methods. The theme is human and is <br id="r3l99">

            perfectly reproduced. <br id="r3l105">
            
            The technique of Agnes Sorma is flaw¬ <br id="r3l106">
            
            less. Facial play gesture, movement, <br id="r3l107">
            
            modulation of voice and diction are em¬ <br id="r3l108">
            
            ployed with sobrietv and rare judgment. <br id="r3l109">
            
            She produces her effects by the simplest <br id="r3l110">
            
            methods. Last night she individuallzed <br id="r3l111">
            
            the poor girl whose romance became a <br id="r3l112">
            
            rragedy with extraordinary definiteness. <br id="r3l113">
            
            There was not a detail which was su¬ <br id="r3l114">
            
            perfluous, not a moment of inconsistency <br id="r3l115">
            
            nor a lapse in characterlzation. She <br id="r3l116">
            
            presented a perfect, graphic portrait, so <br id="r3l117">
            
            complete that it laid bare heart and soul. <br id="r3l118">
            
            In doing this by purely natural methods <br id="r3l119">
            
            she illustrated the high power of the <br id="r3l120">
            
            school of realism. <br id="r3l121">
            
            But there is unfortunately a shadow <br id="r3l122">
            
            on her art—the lack of feeling, of mag¬ <br id="r3l123">
            
            netism, of power to touch the heart, as <br id="r3l124">
            
            well as to satisfy the intellect, to draw <br id="r3l125">
            
            one’s sympathies while evoking one’s <br id="r3l126">
