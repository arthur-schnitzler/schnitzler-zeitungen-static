            of our youth and what became of it after¬ <br id="r1l3">
            
            wards. <br id="r1l4">
            
            Flint: Are vou holding that against me? <br id="r1l5">
            
            I know that I fought against your enterprise. <br id="r1l6">
            
            I did not believe in your institution; but that <br id="r1l7">
            
            was my conviction at that time; we all make <br id="r1l8">
            
            mistakes; but there is one thing, I never act <br id="r1l9">
            
            against my convictions— <br id="r1l10">
            
            Bernhardi: Are vou sure of that? <br id="r1l11">
            
            Flint: Bernhardi!!! <br id="r1l12">
            
            Bernhardi: Let me tell you. I am think¬ <br id="r1l13">
            
            ing of a case—when you acted directly against <br id="r1l14">
            
            your conviction. <br id="r1l15">
            
            Flint: Now this is too much! <br id="r1l16">
            
            (Walks up and down <br id="r1l17">
            
            Bernhardi: Wait! <br id="r1l18">
            
            the room a few times, and suddenly stands <br id="r1l19">
            
            still.) We were both assistant physicians at <br id="r1l20">
            
            Rappenweiler’s. A young man was a patient <br id="r1l21">
            
            in our clinic. I see him lie before me now; I <br id="r1l22">
            
            even know his name, Engelhart Wagner. Our <br id="r1l23">
            
            chief—we all—had made a false diagnosis of <br id="r1l24">
            
            his case. The autopsy revealed the fact that <br id="r1l25">
            
            another treatment would have saved him. And <br id="r1l26">
            
            as we stood there, when the fact was made <br id="r1l27">
            
            clear, you whispered to me; “I knew it.“ Vou <br id="r1l28">
            
            knew what was the matter with the patient; <br id="r1l29">
            
            you had the correct diagnosis. <br id="r1l30">
            
            Flint: The only one. <br id="r1l31">
            
            Bernhardi: Yes, vou were the only one. <br id="r1l32">
            
            Yet you carefully avoided, while he was alive, <br id="r1l33">
            
            making it known. And why you did it is a <br id="r1l34">
            
            question you may answer yourself. I do not <br id="r1l35">
            
            suppose it was conviction. <br id="r1l36">
            
            Flint: By Jovel you have a good memory. <br id="r1l37">
            
            I remember the case, and I’lI admit that I <br id="r1l38">
            
            box 31/8 <br id="r2l1">
            
            PROFESSOR BERNHARDI: A PLAY 25 <br id="r2l2">
            
            considered the other treatment the right one; <br id="r2l3">
            
            and I will also admit that Ikept silent besause <br id="r2l4">
            
            I did not want to hurt the chief’s pride by <br id="r2l5">
            
            showing that one of his assistants knew more <br id="r2l6">
            
            about the case than he did. Vou have reason <br id="r2l7">
            
            to reproach me with sacrificing a human life. <br id="r2l8">
            
            understand. What was the one victim com¬ <br id="r2l9">
            
            pared to the hundreds of other human lives <br id="r2l10">
            
            which could be entrusted later to my skill? <br id="r2l11">
            
            Bernhardi: And you think that Rappen¬ <br id="r2l12">
            
            weiler would have turned against yon? <br id="r2l13">
            
            Flint: That is very probable. You over¬ <br id="r2l14">
            
            rate humanity. You do not know how nar¬ <br id="r2l15">
            
            row-minded people are. It might have meant <br id="r2l16">
            
            a long delay in my career, and I had to ad¬ <br id="r2l17">
            
            vance rapidly to gain the proper sphere of ac¬ <br id="r2l18">
            
            tion for my capacities, which even you cannot <br id="r2l19">
            
            deny. Therefore, my dear Bernhardi, I per¬ <br id="r2l20">
            
            mitted Engelhart Wagner to die, and I am un¬ <br id="r2l21">
            
            able even to regret it. For it does not matter <br id="r2l22">
            
            much, my dear Bernhardi, whether or not you <br id="r2l23">
            
            may act correctly, or even be true to your con¬ <br id="r2l24">
            
            victions in some immaterial detail, the thing <br id="r2l25">
            
            is to serve the one main idea of your life with <br id="r2l26">
            
            faithfulness. It is interesting to me that you <br id="r2l27">
            
            bring this poor Engelhart Wagner out of his <br id="r2l28">
            
            oblivion; for suddenly I am able to recognize <br id="r2l29">
            
            the essential differences in our two natures. <br id="r2l30">
            
            You will be astonished, Bernhardi, to learn of <br id="r2l31">
            
            their capacity to supplement each other, as it <br id="r2l32">
            
            were. You, Bernhardi, are probably much <br id="r2l33">
            
            more than I what the world calls “a respect¬ <br id="r2l34">
            
            able man.“ But whether you are more capable <br id="r2l35">
            
            than I to do more for the general good seems <br id="r2l36">
