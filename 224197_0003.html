            PAUL H. GRUMMANN <br id="r1l5">
            
            Again and again Schnitzler utilized the observations which he had made <br id="r1l6">
            
            as a physician in his works. His interest, however, is confined to the psychic <br id="r1l7">
            
            phases of his characters. This is particularly evident in his novel, Dying' <br id="r1l8">
            
            (°95), the record of the death of a young consumptive. The instinct to <br id="r1l9">
            
            live is portrayed with rare skill. We follow the man from his optimistic <br id="r1l10">
            
            hopes of ultimate recovery, to his feeling of being completely forsaken — <br id="r1l11">
            
            forsaken by friends, parents, and finally by his sweetheart, who refuses <br id="r1l12">
            
            to die with him, for she also is lured by that mysterious impulse toliveon. <br id="r1l13">
            
            His first works gave evidence that Schnitzler was able to express him¬ <br id="r1l14">
            
            self artistically. Few German authors are to be compared with him in this <br id="r1l15">
            
            respect. Conscious of his ability in this field, he devoted himself to the <br id="r1l16">
            
            further perfecting of his remarkable style. Hostile critics concluded <br id="r1l17">
            
            prematurely that he was therefore devoid of the higher creative faculty, <br id="r1l18">
            
            a criticism that was silenced completely by his first great tirumph in the <br id="r1l19">
            
            drama — the appearance of Flirtation' (°95). <br id="r1l20">
            
            Hans Weiring, violinist in a Vienna theater, has been a widower for <br id="r1l21">
            
            years. He has been a model brother, shielding his sister from the many <br id="r1l22">
            
            temptations about her. She remains a spinster, and her life passes by with¬ <br id="r1l23">
            
            out real joy. At her death Weiring is confronted by the question whether <br id="r1l24">
            
            he has after all rendered a great service to her. He is haunted by the <br id="r1l25">
            
            memory of her quiet resignation, and feels that he is to blame for the utter <br id="r1l26">
            
            lack of inspiration and joy in her existence. As a musician at the theater, <br id="r1l27">
            
            he naturally comes to value the romantic sides of life, and therefore he <br id="r1l28">
            
            decides that he will not stand over his daughter Christine with as firma <br id="r1l29">
            
            hand as he had in the case of his sister. Christine, in her most impression¬ <br id="r1l30">
            
            able years, becomes acquainted with Mizi, who does not possess a vestige <br id="r1l31">
            
            of virtue. Mizi throws a glamor over her love affairs, and introduces <br id="r1l32">
            
            Christine to Fritz Lobheimer. Christine is told that this is only a temporary <br id="r1l33">
            
            relation, but her innate purity makes her assume that it must be more. <br id="r1l34">
            
            Lobheimer has an entanglement with a married woman, and he subordi¬ <br id="r1l35">
            
            nates Christine to this other interest. The husband whom he is betraying <br id="r1l36">
            
            traps him and challenges him to a duel. On the night before this duel is <br id="r1l37">
            
            fought, Fritz comes to Christine’s home and realizes from the atmosphere <br id="r1l38">
            
            of the humble place that Christine is superior in every way. Nothing is <br id="r1l39">
            
            said of the duel, and no farewell is taken. After his death Christine realizes <br id="r1l40">
            
            what a trivial part she has played in his life and commits suicide. Her <br id="r1l41">
            
            lapse is motivated not only by the absence of a mother and the beautiful <br id="r1l42">
            
            but unsound lenience of her father — but also by the attitude of various <br id="r1l43">
            
            characters of her environment who indirectly help in shaping her inner life. <br id="r1l44">
            
            A summer resort in the vicinity of Vienna is the scene of the next play, <br id="r1l45">
            
            Free Game’ (°96). The theatrical company is the center of interest in <br id="r1l46">
