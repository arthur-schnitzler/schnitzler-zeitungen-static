            Schlager, a smart young milliner, merry, light-hearted and <br id="r2l2">
            
            good-natured, soon to be followed byChristine. There follows <br id="r2l3">
            
            a delightful hour, Theodor and Mizi doing their best to cheer <br id="r2l4">
            
            up Fritz and Christine, For Christine is sad; she is deeply <br id="r2l5">
            
            in love with Fritz, and therefore feels that his love of her is <br id="r2l6">
            
            not what she wishes it to be; he dees not come to see her as <br id="r2l7">
            
            often as she should wish; moreover, she has seen him at the <br id="r2l8">
            
            Opera the other day in company of a lady to whom he was <br id="r2l9">
            
            paying marked attentions, and her jealousy is roused. Vet <br id="r2l10">
            
            so irresistible is the merry mood ofthe others that both Fritz <br id="r2l11">
            
            and Christine cannot help joining in. After supper, while <br id="r2l12">
            
            music and dancing are going on, the general merriment is <br id="r2l13">
            
            suddenly interrupted by a bell. Fritz asks the girls and bis <br id="r2l14">
            
            friend to wait in the adjoining room, while he himself goes to <br id="r2l15">
            
            open the door to the husband of his mistress. Not many <br id="r2l16">
            
            words are exchanged; the wronged husband returns the <br id="r2l17">
            
            letters to his wife and brings the challenge to a duel. Now <br id="r2l18">
            
            all is lost. When the visitor has left Fritz calls in Theodor <br id="r2l19">
            
            and explains to him in a few hurried words who his visitor <br id="r2l20">
            
            was; the duel is to take place in two days. Theodor is the <br id="r2l21">
            
            self-same night to go and find out another friend who is to <br id="r2l22">
            
            act as second. Theodor tries to make light of the affair, but <br id="r2l23">
            
            Fritz knows that in two days he will be a dead man. Then <br id="r2l24">
            
            the girls are called in; of course the are kept in ignorance <br id="r2l25">
            
            as to what has occurred, and the happy evening is continued <br id="r2l26">
            
            until the time has come to leave. <br id="r2l27">
            
            Christine's room. Christine, who is on the point <br id="r2l28">
            
            Acr II. of going out, is detained by Catherine Binder a, <br id="r2l29">
            
            neighbouring hosier’s wife, who comes to ask her to go out <br id="r2l30">
            
            with them in the evening, but the girl refuses, for she knows <br id="r2l31">
            
            quite well that Catherine’s cousin will be of the party, and <br id="r2l32">
            
            the young man being very much in love with her Christine <br id="r2l33">
            
            does not wish to encourage his advances. Their conver¬ <br id="r2l34">
            
            sation is interrupted by old Weiring; his kindly face is <br id="r2l35">
            
            beaming on his daughter while he hands her a spray of lilac and <br id="r2l36">
            
            urges her to go out into the wonderful spring air. Christine <br id="r2l37">
            
            leaves, glad to be able to get off. Her father’s eyes follow <br id="r2l38">
            
            her tenderly; though his child has not breathed a wordto him <br id="r2l39">
            
            he knows her secret and gladly allows her to live her dream <br id="r2l40">
            
            of love. And to Mrs. Binder’s spiteful remark whether it is <br id="r2l41">

            simply answers by describing to her his late sister, whom he <br id="r2l43">
