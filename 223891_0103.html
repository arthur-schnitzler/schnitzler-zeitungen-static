            Before announcing the plan, we went over all phases most carefully with <br id="r1l90">
            
            authors, representative booksellers and joßbers, and obtained their <br id="r1l91">

            problems of the book trade or as a temporary stimulant to offset any <br id="r1l94">

            under all trade conditions. Itis our sincere belief that every factor in the <br id="r1l96">
            
            book business will be helped by the new policy. Literature is likely to <br id="r1l97">
            
            thrive and publishing and book-selling more likely to prosper in proportion <br id="r1l98">
            
            as America develops a wide book-reading, book-buying and book-owning <br id="r1l99">
            
            habit. The new Inner Sanctum novels at one dollar are designed to aid in <br id="r1l100">
            
            attaining this eminently desirable objective. This is not a war against <br id="r1l101">
            
            book clubs, a campaign against leading libraries, or anything of that sort. <br id="r1l102">
            
            The wider the interest in books the better for book clubs, for lending <br id="r1l103">
            
            libraries, as well as for publishers and booksellers. <br id="r1l104">
            
            Dur only common enemies are mental inertia, the book-borrowing habit <br id="r1l105">
            
            and the widespread unwillingness to regard the regular reading of good <br id="r1l106">
            
            books as an indispensable element in the life of civilized persons. <br id="r1l107">
            
            By safeguarding and enhancing the quality of books and at the same <br id="r1l108">

            the best aims of literature and publishing will be measurably promoted. <br id="r1l110">

            „We often repeat that we live in an <br id="r2l43">

            Casanova was the talk of the town! <br id="r2l54">
