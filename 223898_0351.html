            lay that old Ehrenberg comes along the road at the <br id="r4l27">
            
            same moment. He sees Oskar taking off his hat in <br id="r4l28">
            
            ront of the church doo <br id="r4l29">

            town! <br id="r4l35">
            
            So it is not particularly remarkable that the <br id="r4l36">
            
            story was known all over the town the very same evening. <br id="r4l37">
            
            t is already in some of the papers today. The Jewish <br id="r4l38">

            a Jury for sacrilege or blasphemy. <br id="r4l43">
            
            It is in the long conversation between the Baron <br id="r4l44">
            
            and Heinrich Bermann, brilliant writer, moody, cyni¬ <br id="r4l45">

            his are always bringing up their race, either apolo¬ <br id="r4l53">
            
            getically or as if they wanted to start a quarrel. At the <br id="r4l54">
            
            home of Anna Rosner he mects Dr. Stauber, who is <br id="r4l55">
            
            xplaining how his family is related to the Golow. s, <br id="r4l56">
            
            which numbers two militant members, Theresa, a rad <br id="r4l57">
            
            al political worker, and Leo, radical Jewish nationalist. <br id="r4l58">
            
            When the Doctor finally added in a resigned tone: <br id="r4l59">
            
            The Baron is bound to know that all Jews are related <br id="r4l60">
            
            to one another,’ to quote from rhe novel: <br id="r4l61">
            
            it <br id="r4l62">
            
            George smiled amlably. As a matter of fact <br id="r4l63">
            
            rather Jarred on his nerves. There was no necessity at <br id="r4l64">
            
            all, in his view, for Doctor Stauber as well officially to <br id="r4l65">
            
            communicate to him his membership of the Jewish com¬ <br id="r4l66">
            
            nunity. He already knew it and bore him no grudges <br id="r4l67">
            
            for it. He bore him no grudge at all for it; but why do <br id="r4l68">
            
            hey always begin to talk about it themselves? Wherever <br id="r4l69">
            
            he went, he only met Jews who were ashamed of being <br id="r4l70">
            
            Jews, or the type who were proud of it and were fright¬ <br id="r4l71">
            
            ened of people thinking they were ashamed of it. <br id="r4l72">
            
            Thus again whien lie runs into Heinrich for the first <br id="r4l73">

            The only thing which gives me a certain amount <br id="r4l76">

            supposed to be inflnitely difficult, not to say impossible. <br id="r4l83">
            
            for people like myself. <br id="r4l84">
            
            George gave a slight start. He knew that Heinrich <br id="r4l85">
            
            had been subjected to the most violent personal attacks <br id="r4l86">
            
            by the clerical and conservative press, particularly with <br id="r4l87">
            
            eference to his last piece. <br id="r4l88">
            
            But what’s that got to <br id="r4l89">
            
            do with me?“ thought George. There was another one <br id="r4l90">
            
            of them who had been insulted! It was really absolutel) <br id="r4l91">

            footing <br id="r4l93">
            
            George tells him that he, too, has been expoed to the <br id="r4l94">
            
            public, that there are any number of people prejudiced <br id="r4l95">
            
            against him because he is a Baron. Heinrich answers: <br id="r4l96">
            
            I think you will agree with me, that being ragged <br id="r4l97">
