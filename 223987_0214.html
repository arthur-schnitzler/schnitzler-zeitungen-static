            Hannele the spectacle of seeing her <br id="r3l4">
            
            playing a 12-year-old child was al¬ <br id="r3l5">
            
            most too severe a strain upon the <br id="r3l6">

            for a single scene, but even here vocally <br id="r3l11">
            
            her performance was by no mears <br id="r3l12">
            
            childish. Later, when in the course of her <br id="r3l13">

            robes of Hannele and prepares to enter <br id="r3l15">
            
            her golden coffin, and later, when with the <br id="r3l16">

            was not by any means so little at that. <br id="r3l21">
            
            After all,it is only a stop from <br id="r3l22">
            
            the sublime to the Uncle Tom’s Cabin <br id="r3l23">

            effects were in nearly every instance <br id="r3l25">
            
            pointed so high that all illusion was lest. <br id="r3l26">
            
            Never from an electrical and mechahical <br id="r3l27">
            
            point of view bas Hannele“ been so <br id="r3l28">
            
            elaborately mounted, but never before <br id="r3l29">
            
            have we seen a performance of it whic’ <br id="r3l30">
            
            carried so little conviction. Forthis, it is <br id="r3l31">
            
            true, the overlighting was partly toblame, <br id="r3l32">
            
            but at the same time Mrs. Fiske's own <br id="r3l33">
            
            portrayal was mest seriously at fäult. <br id="r3l34">
            
            Throughout thero was an overelaboration <br id="r3l35">
            
            which seriously hurt the play. <br id="r3l36">
            
            As a matter öf fact,Hanhele“ is a <br id="r3l37">
            
            play to be read rather than acted. It <br id="r3l38">
            
            deals with such sacred and celestial things <br id="r3l39">
            
            that no stage management in the world <br id="r3l40">
            
            can present it fittingly; besides, the pres¬ <br id="r3l41">
            
            ence of the figure of the Saviour on the <br id="r3l42">
            
            stage in the full glare of the lime¬ <br id="r3l43">
            
            light is just as objectionable to many <br id="r3l44">
            
            thousands of theatregoers as it was <br id="r3l45">
            
            when first shown here sixteen years ago. <br id="r3l46">
            
            It’s all very well to say that this figure is <br id="r3l47">
            
            w.erely Hannele’s friend, Dr. Gottwald, <br id="r3l48">
            
            glorified by thechild’s fervid imagination, <br id="r3l49">
            
            but the intent and the result is to present <br id="r3l50">
            
            an actual figure of the Christ, Gottwald <br id="r3l51">
            
            is, of course, the most important röle <br id="r3l52">
            
            in Hannele, and here again there was a <br id="r3l53">
            
            interpretation of it. That wonderful <br id="r3l54">
            
            speech in the second scene he rendered <br id="r3l55">
            
            in a monotonous way, which had no real <br id="r3l56">
            
            trace of tenderness. Miss Alice John <br id="r3l57">
            
            played the nun beautifully, and Wilfred <br id="r3l58">
            
            Buckland’s makeup as the Tall Dirk <br id="r3l59">
            
            Angel was singularly impressive. But <br id="r3l60">
            
            for äll that there was not one moment <br id="r3l61">
            
            when the play really caught and held <br id="r3l62">
            
            yon. Great as it may be as a poetio <br id="r3l63">
            
            fantasy, it does not belong by righis in <br id="r3l64">
            
            Mrs. Fiske’s splendid répertoire. <br id="r3l65">
            
            Before Hannele“ began the house was <br id="r3l66">
            
            plunged into darkness, and for what <br id="r3l67">
            
            seemed like at least ten minutes the audi¬ <br id="r3l68">
            
            ence had to listen to a dirge-like over¬ <br id="r3l69">
            
            ture. The effect was maddening. For <br id="r3l70">
            
            a few minutes, “the people that in dark¬ <br id="r3l71">
            
            iness sat' behaved becomingly. Then <br id="r3l72">
            
            ffrom all parts of the house came bursts <br id="r3l73">
            
            of impatient applause. But still the agony <br id="r3l74">
            
            piled on. If that curtain had remained <br id="r3l75">
            
            down another half minute there would <br id="r3l76">
            
            have been bursts öf hysterical laughter, <br id="r3l77">
            
            which would have ruined the play. Even <br id="r3l78">
            
            in a Hauptmann drama there is such a <br id="r3l79">
            
            thing as exceeding the agony limits. <br id="r3l80">
            
            Mrs. Fiske, for subsequent performances. <br id="r3l81">
            
            will be wise to cut that overture. <br id="r3l82">
            
            The curtain raiser, The Green. Cocka¬ <br id="r3l83">
            
            too,“ seemed a great deal of fuss aböut <br id="r3l84">
            
            othing. Its costumes were elaborate <br id="r3l85">
            
            and its cast was as long as your arm, but <br id="r3l86">
            
            ithere was not a single character which <br id="r3l87">
            
            stood out from the others to any romark¬ <br id="r3l88">
            
            able extent, and for half an hour the play <br id="r3l89">
            
            proved a powerful bore. Thete was <br id="r3l90">
            
            action in the last three minutes of it but <br id="r3l91">
            
            not enough to make it in any way success. <br id="r3l92">
            
            Mr. Blinn, Mr. Mackay and Miss John <br id="r3l93">
            
            stand out as individuals. Unless it has <br id="r3l94">
            
            a remarkably powerful story, there is <br id="r3l95">
            
            nothing on earth can prove more boring <br id="r3l96">
            
            than one of these elaborately costumed <br id="r3l97">
