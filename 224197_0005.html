            mitted that this book, especially when it is read in connection with the other <br id="r1l8">
            
            works of this period, is of peculiar value. It divests the erotic relations of <br id="r1l9">
            
            all glamor that might attach to them per sc. The prostitute, the soldier, <br id="r1l10">
            
            the chambermaid, the young man, the young wife, the husband, the’sweet <br id="r1l11">
            
            girlie, the poet, the actress, and the count reveal their psychic reactions <br id="r1l12">
            
            in all their crudeness and banality. The book is a proper reminder that <br id="r1l13">
            
            these characters differ radically from those described in the other dramas <br id="r1l14">
            
            and novels. <br id="r1l15">
            
            In bold contrast with this work The Legacy' (°98) portrays a relation, <br id="r1l16">
            
            which to conventional society is sinful, but is pure from a broadly human <br id="r1l17">
            
            point of view. Adolf Losatti, professor and national representative, has <br id="r1l18">
            
            been a prominent liberal for years. This has involved little danger and <br id="r1l19">
            
            sacrifice, for he has always been punctilious in honoring the conventions. <br id="r1l20">
            
            Wherever the conventions have not interfered, he has felt free to yield to <br id="r1l21">
            
            moral laxness. His wife, originally a woman of some spontaneity, has <br id="r1l22">
            
            gradually learned to suppress her impulses in accordance with his wishes. <br id="r1l23">
            
            His son, Hugo, a man of charming personality, becomes infatuated with <br id="r1l24">
            
            Toni Weber, who falls in love with him so completely that she leaves her <br id="r1l25">
            
            narrow father in order to live with him. A child is born to them, and Hugo <br id="r1l26">
            
            assumes full responsibility for it Hy supporting the two and visiting them <br id="r1l27">
            
            secretly. He is brought home mortally injured by a fall during a horseback <br id="r1l28">
            
            ride. He now reveals his secret to his parents and demands that his child <br id="r1l29">
            
            and its mother be taken into the family. This legacy' is accepted at first, <br id="r1l30">
            
            but when the child dies, Toni is turned out with the result that she com¬ <br id="r1l31">
            
            mits suicide. Hugo’s sister, Franziska, shows a deep sympathy for Toni. <br id="r1l32">
            
            She is engaged to a young physician, who has all of the petty virtues of the <br id="r1l33">
            
            self-made philistine. Since he has played an important part in making <br id="r1l34">
            
            this home impossible for Toni, Franziska breaks her engagement with him. <br id="r1l35">
            
            Without the slightest preachment, this drama establishes the validity <br id="r1l36">
            
            of genuine morality in conflict with conventional standards. Losatti, the <br id="r1l37">
            
            illiteral liberal is not at all shocked that his son should have a mistress, but <br id="r1l38">
            
            he is dumbfounded that he should remain true to her. It pains him that his <br id="r1l39">
            
            son could think of rearing this illegitimate child in the very neighborhood <br id="r1l40">
            
            where his family lives. Each act closes with a death scene. This has <br id="r1l41">
            
            been criticized as conventional and weak, but the scenes are so varied and <br id="r1l42">
            
            the climax in the third act is built up so skilfully, that the criticism loses <br id="r1l43">
            
            its validity. <br id="r1l44">
            
            The Wife of the Wise Man' (°98) is a series of five novelettes which <br id="r1l45">
            
            describe episodes in which a man is deceived by his wife, whom he forgives <br id="r1l46">
            
            for her lapses. With rare skill Schnitzler has avoided all dangerof having <br id="r1l47">
