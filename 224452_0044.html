            theatre when English drama reflected the tempera¬ <br id="r1l13">
            
            own. It is not the morality of marriage—Christian or <br id="r1l14">
            
            ment of English life. The first and greatest was <br id="r1l15">
            
            secular. But it is none the less definite; and so long <br id="r1l16">

            of the later Stuarts. The second period was quite <br id="r1l19">
            
            lnws his comedy is consistent and morally inoffensive. <br id="r1l20">
            
            unlike anything within English historical experience <br id="r1l21">
            
            His English eritics would have him wind up with a <br id="r1l22">
            
            before or since. It was unique, brief, and brilliant— <br id="r1l23">
            
            moral in favour of English family lise, not perceiving <br id="r1l24">
            
            so unique that it had to invent a special sort of comedy <br id="r1l25">
            
            that this would destroy not only the artistic but the <br id="r1l26">
            
            for its expression, quite unlike anvthing in native or <br id="r1l27">
            
            moral value of his comedy. It is conceivably of no <br id="r1l28">

            poured into copper, the result is a red fume, which is <br id="r1l32">
            
            entirely lost; so brilliant that even the critics who <br id="r1l33">
            
            nice or nasty according to taste: but it quite certainly <br id="r1l34">

            was in its best examples the perfect expression of a <br id="r1l41">
            
            further. Schnitzler, like Congreve, expresses in his <br id="r1l42">
            
            very definite and positive morality. But it was not <br id="r1l43">

            comedies are founded upon a positive system of <br id="r1l46">
