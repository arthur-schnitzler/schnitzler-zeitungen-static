            realized very clearly in the beginning that at best the future <br id="r1l12">

            things which have a greater hold on men. <br id="r1l28">

            lived happiness. And, take my word for it, this sort of com¬ <br id="r1l48">
            
            never hated him; I do not hate him now. Why, there’s abso¬ <br id="r1l49">

            lutely no ground for hate—and none for forgiveness either. <br id="r1l51">
            
            OLGA:—I can conceive of it ending differently. <br id="r1l52">
            
            She belonged to him. Pray, let’s not lose sight of that. Let <br id="r1l53">

            OLGA (Dispassionately) :—There in a nutshell is the great <br id="r1l72">
            
            advantage you men possess—I mean men of yeur cut. <br id="r1l73">

            ROB:—But she had to have a confidante, that’s very plain; <br id="r1l78">
            
            knew very little, as you are aware. I went my way and she <br id="r1l79">
            
            and you could not help being hers; that’s evident enough. <br id="r1l80">
            
            went hers. <br id="r1l81">
            
            No. Matters cquld not have continucd thus very long. Do <br id="r1l82">
            
            you think I was blind to the shame hoth endured because of <br id="r1l83">

            their hypocrisy—and how they suffered? I was longing for <br id="r1l85">
            
            ROB:—Of course it was so. She’s probably told you <br id="r1l86">
            
            the moment—yes, patiently awaiting it—when they would <br id="r1l87">

            didn't they find the courage? Why didn't I say to them, <br id="r1l91">
            
            There are no surprises and no discoveries for me any more. <br id="r1l92">
