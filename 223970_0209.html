            Pending the renaissance of the English theatre, <br id="r1l14">
            
            enthusiasts in London might well turn their attention to thé <br id="r1l15">
            
            literary drama of Vienna. Dr. Arthur Schnitzler, its prinel¬ <br id="r1l16">
            
            pal exponent, is a writer to whom the questionof“ Stateald“ <br id="r1l17">
            
            is of less moment than the attainment of an artistio <br id="r1l18">
            
            purpose. That he can deal with the stage in the conventional <br id="r1l19">
            
            —i.e., the French—manner is sufficiently proved by bis <br id="r1l20">
            
            brilliant one-act plays, such as Der grüne Kakadu, orthe <br id="r1l21">
            
            later Lebendige Stunden, If he neglects the rules, as some <br id="r1l22">
            
            indigenous critics complain, in longer pieces, it is because <br id="r1l23">
            
            of a deliberate search for more adequate modes of expression. <br id="r1l24">
            
            The persons in his latest play, Der einsame Weg, speak a <br id="r1l25">
            
            Schnitzlerdialect, revealing themselves in finely chlselled <br id="r1l26">
            
            quotable language, like the people in Shakespeare, or Molière, <br id="r1l27">
            
            or Euripides. The wise, before they censure, will ask“ What <br id="r1l28">
            
            does the author intend ?“ He is obviously no realist in the <br id="r1l29">
            
            vulgar sense. His personages describe their emotions to <br id="r1l30">
            
            each other in whole pages of print, whereas introspective <br id="r1l31">
            
            persons in actual life for the most part carry on self-analysis <br id="r1l32">
            
            within their own bosoms—and hence the soliloquy is, <br id="r1l33">
            
            Frealism for realism, a better convention than the confidences <br id="r1l34">
            
            of a man to“ Charles, his friend.' Moreover, the action in <br id="r1l35">
            
            Der einsame Weg amounts to little more than a passive auffer¬ <br id="r1l36">
            
            ance of the consequences of past conduct. It is a panorama, <br id="r1l37">
            
            in which flgures move across the stage, but do not meet and <br id="r1l38">
            
            clash. The title of the play doubtless gives thekey tothe <br id="r1l39">
            
            idea. The author means to give a picture of solitary lives, <br id="r1l40">
            
            and the very lack of action gives emphasis to the solitude. <br id="r1l41">
            
            In a desert, to meet and fight were better than not to meet. <br id="r1l42">
            
            It matters not then that we catch only a glimpse of certaln <br id="r1l43">
            
            of the characters as they pass. A too clear definition might <br id="r1l44">
            
            Of the two principal persons, both pleasure-seekers <br id="r1l45">
            
            (“ Geniesslinge''), the one, Julian Fichtner, seeks sensa¬ <br id="r1l46">
            
            tion for its own sake, the other, Stephan von Sala, in <br id="r1l47">
            
            order to turn it to artistic account. Both find them¬ <br id="r1l48">
            
            selves in middle life on a lonely road (der einsame Weg), <br id="r1l49">
            
            and fain to feed on husks. Julian reveals the secret of his <br id="r1l50">
            
            illegitimate paternity to Felix, the reputed son of Professor <br id="r1l51">
            
            Wegrath, in the hope that he may have a son’s affection to <br id="r1l52">
            
            cheer his declining years. But the young man is deaf to the <br id="r1l53">
            
            appeal of“ blood relationship. He acknowledges a debt not <br id="r1l54">
            
            to the parent to whom he owes merely his being, but to <br id="r1l55">
            
            Wegrath, who has given him a father’s care and affection all <br id="r1l56">
            
            his life. His sister Johanna, on the other hand, turns from <br id="r1l57">
            
            her actual parents and seeks satisfaction in her love for <br id="r1l58">
            
            the worn-out Sala. Gabriele, Wegrath’s wife, dies, her <br id="r1l59">
            
            former connexion with Julian unconfessed. Wegrath, the <br id="r1l60">
            
            simple, honourable man of seience, mourns the loss of <br id="r1l61">
            
            her, without suspicion of her lifelong deceit. Dr. Neu¬ <br id="r1l62">
            
            mann, the family friend, another straightforward simple <br id="r1l63">
            
            person, finds it more natural to do his duty in life than to <br id="r1l64">
            
            indulge in wild adventure, but works without hope of reward <br id="r1l65">
            
            or of the affection which he desires from Johanna. The young <br id="r1l66">
            
            man Felix, the connecting link between all these solitaries, <br id="r1l67">
            
            alone seems able both to enjoy his own life, and to enter with <br id="r1l68">
            
            sympathy into the experiences of the others. The kernel of <br id="r1l69">
            
            the piece is contained in a dialogue in Act IV., in which <br id="r1l70">
            
            Julian, lamenting to Sala his inability to attach Felix to him¬ <br id="r1l71">
            
            self, accuses his friend of never having loved“ a single being <br id="r1l72">
            
            on earth.“' Sala replies :— <br id="r1l73">
            
            And yon, Julian, as little as I. To love is to exist in the <br id="r1l74">
            
            world for the sake of another person. I do not say that is n desirable <br id="r1l75">
            
            condition, but in any case, I fancy, we were both far enough from it. <br id="r1l76">
            
            "Have we ever made a sacrifice from which either our senses or <br id="r1l77">
            
            our vanity did not gain some advantage? Have we ever hesitated to <br id="r1l78">
            
            betray or deceive honourable men, if we thereby could bo the richer by <br id="r1l79">

            life at stake—not out of caprice or vanity—nay, but to secure the well¬ <br id="r1l81">
            
            being of a creature that had given itself to us?.. And could we <br id="r1l82">
            
            venture to demand back from a single being—man or woman—any <br id="r1l83">
            
            single thing that we had bestowed upon him? I do not menn such <br id="r1l84">
            
            things as jewelled pearl, or money, or cheap-bought wisdom, but a <br id="r1l85">
            
            piece of ourselves—an hour of our existence that we have really and <br id="r1l86">
