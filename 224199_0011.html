            dying gloriously in the front of the fray. Among the officers is <br id="r1l7">
            
            Lieutenant Max, who has cast on Marie, the beautiful daughter, <br id="r1l8">
            
            eyes of admiration. Trony, morcover, sharpens the situation when <br id="r1l9">
            
            the bedridden father, who was once riding-master in the Blue <br id="r1l10">
            
            Cuirassiers, explains that he himself was responsible for the <br id="r1l11">
            
            historic flight. <br id="r1l12">
            
            What was the good of it? Who would have thanked me? <br id="r1l13">
            
            They would have put me in a grave with a thousand others and <br id="r1l14">
            
            piled the carth on top, and that would have been the end of it. <br id="r1l15">
            
            And I wouldn't have it. I wanted to live—to live like others. <br id="r1l16">
            
            I wanted to have a wife and children and live. And so I rushed <br id="r1l17">
            
            from the field; and so it has happened that the young men whom <br id="r1l18">
            
            I don't know are going to their death and that I still live on at <br id="r1l19">
            
            seventy-nine and will survive them all—all—all.?' The old soldier, <br id="r1l20">
            
            however, is unduly sanguine as to the protraction of his life, for <br id="r1l21">
            
            the same call of life which ordered him from the battle, orders <br id="r1l22">
            
            his daughter to pour poison into the water for which he now <br id="r1l23">
            
            craves. <br id="r1l24">
            
            It is outside the purpose of this essay to argue the ethics of <br id="r1l25">
            
            this precipitation of the inevitable. Suffice it that it constitutes <br id="r1l26">
            
            a most efficient curtain, a curtain, however, so efficient that there <br id="r1l27">
            
            seems no compelling necessity for a continuation of the play. <br id="r1l28">
            
            A continuation, however, there is, and in the rooms of Max, <br id="r1l29">
            
            which arc visited at night by Marie, who ensconces herself behind <br id="r1l30">
            
            a curtain. She sees the major’s wife come to urge a vain prayer <br id="r1l31">
            
            that he should desert the army and elope with her. They are <br id="r1l32">
            
            discovered by the major, who, shooting the wife, spares the lover. <br id="r1l33">
            
            It is, however, when the major leaves that we understand the¬ <br id="r1l34">
            
            intense hypertrophy of life evoked by imminent death. Marie, <br id="r1l35">
            
            knowing all, yet presents herself. Max can only realise that his life <br id="r1l36">
            
            has but a few remaining hours, and that these remaining hours <br id="r1l37">
            
            stand now before him. Another curtain, strong, if slightly crude, <br id="r1l38">
            
            vet followed by a third act which is nothing but an epilogue. <br id="r1l39">
            
            This somewhat exaggerafed scorn, however, of such of the <br id="r1l40">
            
            more complicated effects of theatricalism as are manifested in the <br id="r1l41">
            
            ingenious concatenation of the plot, or the representation of <br id="r1l42">
            
            sensational incidents which have no justification but their own <br id="r1l43">
            
            inherent dramatic force, fails absolutely to affect Schnitzler’s <br id="r1l44">
            
            position as a writer of one-act plays. Indeed, it is his subordina¬ <br id="r1l45">
            
            tion of plot to atmosphere that constitutes in this sphere his <br id="r1l46">
            
            paramount excellence. As, morcover, Mr. Henry James in bis <br id="r1l47">
