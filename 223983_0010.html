            The première was announced for December 23, 1020, in the Kleines <br id="r1l3">
            
            Schauspielhaus. This theatre had been opened in the fall of 1918 by Max <br id="r1l4">
            
            Reinhardt who had leased it from the Hochschule für Musik.? Afterthe <br id="r1l5">
            
            completion of the Großes Schauspielhaus Reinhardt withdrew and was <br id="r1l6">
            
            succeeded first by Dr. Altmann and later by Gertrud Eysoldt and Maxi¬ <br id="r1l7">
            
            milian Sladek. The Hochschule für Musik, and consequently also this <br id="r1l8">
            
            theatre, were under the jurisdiction of the Prussian Ministry of Art, <br id="r1l9">
            
            Science, and Education. At about this time the Social Democratie <br id="r1l10">
            
            ministry desiredtoterminate its contract with the lessees of this theatre <br id="r1l11">
            
            because of its plan to provide high-grade theatrical entertainment forthe <br id="r1l12">
            
            populace at nominal rates. Although no objection had been raised tothe <br id="r1l13">
            
            productions of Wedekind's Die Büchse der Pandora and Frühlings Er¬ <br id="r1l14">
            
            wachen in this theatre under Reinhardt’s direction, the ministry now fell <br id="r1l15">
            
            back on a clause in the contract, contained in all such agreements, which <br id="r1l16">
            
            forbade performances of plays “welche in politischer, religiöser oder <br id="r1l17">
            
            sittlicher Beziehung Anstoß erregen.? A few hours before the première <br id="r1l18">
            
            the Hochschule für Musik obtained an injunction against the perform¬ <br id="r1l19">
            
            ance under threat of imprisonment, on the ground that the book had <br id="r1l20">
            
            repeatedly been declared immoral.s° The directors, however, ignored <br id="r1l21">
            
            this, resolved to make an issue of it. The première took place without <br id="r1l22">
            
            any untoward incidents, and the majority of papers, with the exception <br id="r1l23">
            
            of the Tägliche Rundschau and a few others of the extreme right, spoke <br id="r1l24">
            
            very highly of the artistic and discreet staging of these dialogs. On Janu¬ <br id="r1l25">
            
            ary 3, 1921, the injunction was voided by the same court (6. Zivilkam¬ <br id="r1l26">
            
            mer des Landgerichts in) that had isse#ed it, after the directors had been <br id="r1l27">
            
            given a hearing and after the members ofthe court had witnessed a per¬ <br id="r1l28">
            
            formance. In a carefully considered opinion the court not merely upheld <br id="r1l29">
            
            every claim of the defendants, but even calledthe performance“a moral <br id="r1l30">
            
            deed'’ and concluded:"Es kann für die Aufhaltung des sittlichen Ver¬ <br id="r1l31">
            
            falles nur förderlich sein, diese Dinge so zurückhaltend und sachlich und <br id="r1l32">
            
            zugleich so deutlich und rücksichtslos aufzudecken und zur Erörterung <br id="r1l33">
            
            zu stellen, wie es hier geschieht. )'3 <br id="r1l34">
            
            Although the findings of the court were widely published in the papers, <br id="r1l35">
            
            the prosecuting attorney's oflice of Landgericht mi almost immediately <br id="r1l36">
            
            began an investigation of its own as tothe propriety of the performance. <br id="r1l37">
            
            On February 4, 1921, Professor Karl Brunner, Regierungsrat in the <br id="r1l38">
            
            Prussian Ministry of Social Welfare and attached to the Zentral¬ <br id="r1l39">
            
            polizeistelle zur Bekämpfung unzüchtiger Schriften'' as expert adviser, <br id="r1l40">
            
            submitted a report in which he denounced the performance in no uncer¬ <br id="r1l41">
            
            tain terms and advised rigorous action. Professor Brunner also attended <br id="r1l42">
            
            a meeting of the female contingent ofthe Reichstag, called with the <br id="r1l43">
            
            intention of presenting an interpellation at the next session of the <br id="r1l44">
            
            Reichstag. A protest was drafted with his active assistance which was <br id="r1l45">
            
            later submitted to numerous societies in Ber in and the provinces and <br id="r1l46">
            
            signed by a host of people who had neither seen the performance nor read <br id="r1l47">
            
            the book. In this manner pressure was exerted on the prosecuting at¬ <br id="r1l48">
            
            torney. On the basis of Professor Brunner’s report proceedings were in¬ <br id="r1l49">
            
            stituted against the directors and actors involved. <br id="r1l50">
            
            During all this time no attempt had been made, outside of legal chan¬ <br id="r1l51">
            
            nels, to interfere with the performance. On February 22, 1921, however, <br id="r1l52">
            
            an organized and prearranged demonstration on the part of nationalistic <br id="r1l53">
            
            and anti-Semitic elements took place in the fourth scene, amounting <br id="r1l54">
            
            almost to a riot. At a certain passage various members of the audience <br id="r1l55">
            
            began to shout“Schweinerei,'“ etc. This was the signal for the release of <br id="r1l56">
            
            stink-bombs, and a considerable uproar ensued. The directors as well as <br id="r1l57">
            
            the police had been forewarned and had taken precautionary measurcs. <br id="r1l58">
            
            Several dozen men and women were arrested and transported to the <br id="r1l59">
            
            police station, whereupon the performance was continued. <br id="r1l60">
            
            In view of the court'’s decision cited above the prosecuting attorney <br id="r1l61">
            
            foresaw difficulties in making out a case. Upon his motion the court (6. <br id="r1l62">
            
            Strafkammer of Landgericht in) on June 11 decided to drop the charge <br id="r1l63">
            
            against the defen lants since having ested in good faith, it was impos¬ <br id="r1l64">
