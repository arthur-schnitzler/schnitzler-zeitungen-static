            coming is practically a tract on the <br id="r1l28">
            
            vanity of human wishes. <br id="r1l29">
            
            Dr. Otto P. Schinnerer has written <br id="r1l30">
            
            a historical introduction for this edi¬ <br id="r1l31">

            which has been published once before <br id="r1l33">
            
            in the United States. He recalls that <br id="r1l34">
            
            the problem of the approach of age <br id="r1l35">
            
            has repeatedly occupied Schnitzler. <br id="r1l36">
            
            We already find it touched upon in <br id="r1l37">
            
            Bertha Garland and in Beatrice, <br id="r1l38">

            by the jealousy of an aging man for <br id="r1l49">
            
            a young rival. In the present story, <br id="r1l50">
            
            too, in one of the most effectlve and <br id="r1l51">

            facing youth.“ <br id="r1l55">
            
            And Dr. Schinnerer makes one other <br id="r1l56">
            
            observation—that an author may put <br id="r1l57">
            
            himself into a story or through his <br id="r1l58">
            
            personal experience become more sym¬ <br id="r1l59">
            
            pathetic with a situation; that in <br id="r1l60">
            
            1915, when Schnitzler set to work on <br id="r1l61">
            
            this book, he had just reached the <br id="r1l62">
            
            age of fifty-three. As Josef Korner <br id="r1l63">
            
            has remarked, only a young man of <br id="r1l64">
            
            the world could have written Anatol, <br id="r1l65">
            
            only a mature man Intermezzo, and <br id="r1l66">
            
            only an aging one Casanova's Home¬ <br id="r1l67">
            
            coming.“ Dr. Schinnerer thinks the <br id="r1l68">
            
            book reveals Schnitzler at the height <br id="r1l69">
            
            of his powers. <br id="r1l70">
            
            Another reprinting of importance is <br id="r1l71">
            
            that of Stephen Crane's Maggie, <br id="r1l72">
            
            which may now be had with the im¬ <br id="r1l73">
            
            print of the Newlands Press. The <br id="r1l74">
            
            edition profits by a number of un¬ <br id="r1l75">
            
            usual impressionistic etchings by Ber¬ <br id="r1l76">
            
            nard Sanders. This is the tale that <br id="r1l77">
            
            nobody wouid print in the nineties, <br id="r1l78">
            
            and which Crane finally published <br id="r1l79">
            
            Kunder the name of Johnston Smith <br id="r1l80">
            
            and tried to sell on the newsstands at <br id="r1l81">
            
            50 cents a copy. The public did not <br id="r1l82">
            
            get interested in the slin: coptes, but <br id="r1l83">
            
            the tale won the admiration of Ham¬ <br id="r1l84">
            
            Iin Garland, who persomally sought <br id="r1l85">
            
            out Crane and encouraged hir and <br id="r1l86">
            
            introduced him to William <br id="r1l87">
            
            Howells. The royal welcome that <br id="r1l88">
            
            Howells gave Maggie is we'l known <br id="r1l89">
            
            and is a tribute to Crane's literary <br id="r1l90">
            
            taste and acumen. It is not difficult <br id="r1l91">
            
            to see why Maggie did not sell—it does <br id="r1l92">
            
            not sell as a popular number even <br id="r1l93">
            
            today. It is not an aphrodisiac nor <br id="r1l94">
            
            sufficlently sensational to make 1# <br id="r1l95">
            
            emotional melodrama, and its hokum <br id="r1l96">
            
            is disappointing. Why should it have <br id="r1l97">
            
            sold generally? It won the approval <br id="r1l98">
