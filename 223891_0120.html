            Mr. Sumner Still. Unreconciled-to-thell <br id="r3l8">
            
            Works of Mr. Schnitzler <br id="r3l9">
            
            To the New York Herald Tribune: <br id="r3l10">
            
            Re your editorial Casanova in <br id="r3l11">
            
            Court“ there are a few statements on <br id="r3l12">
            
            which your readers might like to hear <br id="r3l13">
            
            another view. <br id="r3l14">
            
            You intimate that “a literary master <br id="r3l15">
            
            may treat of subjects which are barred <br id="r3l16">
            
            to literary dubs.“ If this be true, <br id="r3l17">
            
            then Mr. Schnitzler, whose book yon <br id="r3l18">
            
            are defending, apparently is not a <br id="r3l19">
            
            literary master, as a noisy minority <br id="r3l20">
            
            would have us believe. <br id="r3l21">
            
            In June of this year another book <br id="r3l22">
            
            by Mr. Schnitzler came before the Ap¬ <br id="r3l23">
            
            pellate Division of the Supreme Court. <br id="r3l24">
            
            In its opinion sustaining a conviction <br id="r3l25">
            
            that court-said rather sarcastically on <br id="r3l26">
            
            ithe very point which you raise: <br id="r3l27">
            
            We are then told that this cycle <br id="r3l28">
            
            which the book depiets would con¬ <br id="r3l29">
            
            cededly have been à viclous cycie <br id="r3l30">
            
            in the hands of any lesser artist than <br id="r3l31">
            
            Schnitzler. We are not told wliy <br id="r3l32">
            
            Schnitzler is able to surpass all other <br id="r3l33">
            
            writers in the exquisite handling of <br id="r3l34">
            
            the licentious. That gift, however, 18 <br id="r3l35">
            
            clalmed for him by the writer of the <br id="r3l36">
            
            introduction.“ <br id="r3l37">
            
            You will find the same clalm made <br id="r3l38">
            
            in the preface of the Casanova book. <br id="r3l39">
            
            It is one way of apologizing for the <br id="r3l40">
            
            publication of indecency. <br id="r3l41">
            
            The Appellate Division also said of <br id="r3l42">
            
            Schnitzler in the same opinion: <br id="r3l43">
            
            This last quotation stamps the <br id="r3l44">
            
            author as a man whose thoughts thus <br id="r3l45">
            
            expressed cannot escape being char¬ <br id="r3l46">
            
            acterized as indecent.“ <br id="r3l47">
            
            Of course, we understand that some <br id="r3l48">
            
            newspapers have no respect for adverse <br id="r3l49">
            
            Judiclal opinions regarding books, ad¬ <br id="r3l50">
            
            hering to their own attitude of in¬ <br id="r3l51">
            
            tellectual aristocrats.“ However, the <br id="r3l52">
            
            application-of thé law ## the-funetion <br id="r3l53">
            
            of the courts and not of the news¬ <br id="r3l54">
            
            papers. Should a magistrate or court <br id="r3l55">
            
            be swayed by newspaper comment <br id="r3l56">
            
            rather than by Judicial precedent, that <br id="r3l57">
            
            is a publie misfortune. <br id="r3l58">
            
            This puerile harping on the expres¬ <br id="r3l59">
            
            sion Vmid-Victorian-days,“which wovld <br id="r3l60">
            
            mean the ’70s, has no bearing in this <br id="r3l61">
            
            case, fer which a precedent was estab¬ <br id="r3l62">
            
            lished only seven years ago. But, as a <br id="r3l63">
            
            matter of fact, the latest decision of <br id="r3l64">
            
            the Appellate Court went back to de¬ <br id="r3l65">
            
            cisions of 1879 and 1884 for an in¬ <br id="r3l66">
            
            terpretation of the meaning and ap¬ <br id="r3l67">
            
            plication of the anti-obscenlty law. <br id="r3l68">
            
            You say: Mr. Sumner has.lost his <br id="r3l69">
            
            rapport with the fäste and judgmen“ <br id="r3l70">
            
            of the 1930 metropolitan community. <br id="r3l71">
            
            If you intimate that the taste and <br id="r3l72">
            
            Judgment of the 1930 metropolitan <br id="r3l73">
            
            community favor filth in books or on <br id="r3l74">
            
            the stage, which I deny, then the <br id="r3l75">
            
            rapport never existed, and so couid <br id="r3l76">
            
            not have been lost. <br id="r3l77">
            
            Tou still neglect to inform your <br id="r3l78">
            
            readers that the former publisher of <br id="r3l79">
            
            the Casanova bock was indicted by a <br id="r3l80">
            
            grand jury and that Justice Wagner. <br id="r3l81">
            
            of the Supreme Court, refused to hold <br id="r3l82">
            
            as a matter of law that the book was <br id="r3l83">
            
            not obscene. That is what “scared“ a <br id="r3l84">
            
            former publisher into withdrawing the <br id="r3l85">
            
            book, and not Mr. Sumner. <br id="r3l86">
