            is the very linest kind of controversy, between two sincere opponents, <br id="r1l7">
            
            both, granted their preinises, reasonable in their arguments. <br id="r1l8">
            
            But tliis is not the real message of the play, which is an opportunity <br id="r1l9">
            
            for irong and stinging commentary on certain detestable traits in human <br id="r1l10">
            
            nature. Schnitzler’s purpose is to reveal the mean and contemptible <br id="r1l11">
            
            rasealitg which is called forth by an ineident such as the controversy <br id="r1l12">

            selfish aims, pursuing them with a complete disregard for truthfulness, <br id="r1l16">
            
            honour and faith; the vicious and cowardly assistant director of the <br id="r1l17">
            
            hospital, whose green envy surges up ints gloating persecution of his <br id="r1l18">

            hypocrisy of the German Jew-hater; the crawling treachery of the Jew <br id="r1l20">
            
            deserter who wants to show himself more of an anti-Semite than his most <br id="r1l21">
            
            degraded non-Jewish Jew-hater; the frankly opportunist govermment <br id="r1l22">
            
            careerist who, least objectionable of them all, openly admits that only a <br id="r1l23">
            
            fool tells the truth when a lie is popular—these are the meat and bones of <br id="r1l24">
            
            the play. It is no case of a struggle between the Jewish doctor’s <br id="r1l25">
            
            rationalism and the priest’s Christian faith, as might superficially appear. <br id="r1l26">
            
            It is the fight between all that is comprised bar the phrase-ethical decency, <br id="r1l27">
            
            and all that should be includedl in the concept of the foul fiend. <br id="r1l28">
            
            Politics in this play, as is so often the case on the Continent, and <br id="r1l29">
            
            not seldom the case in this countrv, is the synonym for all that is <br id="r1l30">
            
            mnean, treacherous, unscrupulous and selfish. It is interesting to recall <br id="r1l31">
            
            the words of an authoritative writer on that subtle English political <br id="r1l32">
            
            attitude known as Toryism. In reviewing that attitude in its liighest <br id="r1l33">
            
            aspects, he said that it might be regarded, in one respect, das a perpetual <br id="r1l34">
            
            warning that the State, no less than the individual, does well to fear, <br id="r1l35">
            
            lest it do evil that good may come.'' Bernhardi had the misfortune to <br id="r1l36">
            
            take up this Tory attitude on the Continent of Europe, where political <br id="r1l37">
            
            maturity is unknown and where, therefore, the gimcrack dictator thrives <br id="r1l38">
            
            and the human hounds are always ready to smother their cowardice in <br id="r1l39">
            
            the hunt of the defenceless Jew. <br id="r1l40">
            
            As the Professor, Abraham Sofaer gives a magnificent performance, <br id="r1l41">
            
            restrained and convineing, suggestive in every move and inflexion of the <br id="r1l42">
            
            stubbornness for right which has so long been the Jew’s costly heritage. <br id="r1l43">
            
            He makes the man intensely likeable and unaffectedly noble in his <br id="r1l44">
            
            splendid unwisdom, and by his careful definition of the character lights <br id="r1l45">
            
            up much of the purely intellectual argument with an emotion which <br id="r1l46">
            
            is infectious and exciting. Another fine piece of acting is provided by <br id="r1l47">
            
            Ronald Adam, as the “twister'' politician. With much subtlety, the <br id="r1l48">
            
            insincerity of the character is steadily born in upon us, and Mr. Adam <br id="r1l49">
            
            never faulters for a moment in his unobtrusive, I had almost deseribed <br id="r1l50">
            
            it as inevitable, giving away of the smooth scoundrel’s soul. The <br id="r1l51">
            
            large cast in general acts verv well, though there is some tendency to <br id="r1l52">
            
            inaudibility at times. Bernard Merefield, as the priest, invests the part <br id="r1l53">
            
            with sincerity and dignity, and there is a delightfully humorous sketch <br id="r1l54">
            
            of the Government official by that clever actor, Alan Wheatley. <br id="r1l55">
            
            This is a play that every intelligent person, and certainly every <br id="r1l56">
            
            intelligent Jew, should not fail to see. It provides a wealth of food for <br id="r1l57">
            
            discussion, and raises questions which are as lively to-dav as they were <br id="r1l58">
            
            when the piece was written, in many cases more so. It will be a thousand <br id="r1l59">
            
            pities if this production is not transferred, after its fortnight’s run at <br id="r1l60">
            
            the Embassy, to some West End Theatre, for its appeal should be <br id="r1l61">
            
            extremely wide—unless I am unduly optimistic about the brains of <br id="r1l62">

            So far as the production of!Professor Bernhardi'’ in England is <br id="r1l102">
            
            concerned, Herr Schnitzler informed ine that it was played in London, <br id="r1l103">
            
            but only at one Sunday nighit performance, about six years ago, by the <br id="r1l104">
            
            Jewish Drama League. This tüne there is an entirely new English trans¬ <br id="r1l105">
            
            lation which has been admirably done by Mr. Ronald Adam, who is one <br id="r1l106">
            
            of the Directors of the Einbassy Theatre, and Mr. Lewis Borrel. The <br id="r1l107">
            
            cast is an all-English one. <br id="r1l108">

            For English actors, he has a great admiration—Charles Laughton <br id="r1l111">
            
            and Leslie Howard, for example. British films he also considers very good, <br id="r1l112">
            
            and in this connection he singled out The Informer'' for particular praise. <br id="r1l113">

            a potent part in countering anti-Jewish propaganda, Herr Schnitzler said <br id="r1l115">
            
            he believes that both the einema and the theatre could exert a great <br id="r1l116">
