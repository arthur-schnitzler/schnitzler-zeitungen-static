            So, with the best will in the world, we must evade the responsibility which is <br id="r2l5">
            
            thrust upon us. We cannot change a national psychology (Arnold Bennett wrote <br id="r2l6">
            
            the other day that“one of the defects of the Anglo-Saxon temperament is a <br id="r2l7">
            
            passion for interfering with other people’s tastes'’) and we are reluctant ourselves <br id="r2l8">
            
            to disturb even a journalist at play. <br id="r2l9">
            
            But what we can do, we have done. <br id="r2l10">
            
            We have quoted at the head of this article an extract from the comically angust <br id="r2l11">
            
            scolding administered to publishers by one of their Trade-papers, This article in <br id="r2l12">
            
            Dhe Publisher's Circular provoked a letter from one of the paper’s readers, <br id="r2l13">
            
            which letter in its turn provoked an editorial reply. Surely, asked the editor, <br id="r2l14">
            
            Mr.— <br id="r2l15">
            
            would be able to decide if such and such a book is fit to be read by a <br id="r2l16">
            
            lad or girl of sixteen or eighteen?“ <br id="r2l17">
            
            All is now clear. Dur trouble had been precisely that no one seemed to know <br id="r2l18">
            
            what was obscene and what not. Whenthe Publisher’s Circular in its original <br id="r2l19">
            
            article declared that any person of average common-sense can apply the test <br id="r2l20">
            
            which is the basis of these persecutions, viz., whether the tendency of the matter <br id="r2l21">
            
            is to deprave or corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral infiuenees <br id="r2l22">
            
            and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall,'’ we could merely <br id="r2l23">
            
            wring our hands. Suppose we have a tantalus on our sideboard and a weak¬ <br id="r2l24">
            
            minded caller is left alone in the room for ten minutes. Are we ogres of <br id="r2l25">
            
            depravity for putting whisky within the reach of one“open to such immoral <br id="r2l26">
            
            influences'? This sort of thing has no end—at least so it seemed to us.“ But <br id="r2l27">
            
            thanks be, the editor of 7'e Publisher’s Circular has, in his second comment. <br id="r2l28">
            
            supplied the needful precision. <br id="r2l29">
            
            We have immediately sacked all our readers, lest we be tempted to plead their <br id="r2l30">
            
            reports as an excuse for turning out an obscene book. In their place we have <br id="r2l31">
            
            engaged some charming lads and girls ofsixteen and eighteen, to whom we read <br id="r2l32">
            
            aloud by the hour, while experts sit at hand ready to detect the least flush of <br id="r2l33">
            
            shame or pucker of bewilderment on those fair young faces, The grate is full of <br id="r2l34">
            
            charred paper. Dur coal-merchants are in despair. <br id="r2l35">
            
            Who says a trade paper is not a help to the trade? <br id="r2l36">
            
            And weare rigkt. For some astonishing reason the Editor repeated this purely lunatie paragraph in yet a <br id="r2l37">
            
            later number of his paper. Why? Wedo not know. As forthe paragraph itself, it still meanggothing. <br id="r2l38">
            
            ARTHUR SCHNITZLER: <br id="r2l39">
            
            A WRITER FOR THE CIVILISED <br id="r2l40">
            
            An 1892 Schnitzler’s first play Das Märchen was produced in Vienna, declared <br id="r2l41">
            
            Fimmoral' and withdrawn. Fifteen years later it was played again, considered <br id="r2l42">
            
            old fashioned'’ and again withdrawn. <br id="r2l43">
            
            This curions little episode is in a way symbolical of Schnitzler’s genius. His <br id="r2l44">
            
            has always been the essence of sophistication—a shrewd, tolerant, slightly <br id="r2l45">
            
            amused perception of the shifts and hypocrisies of polite society. Such percep¬ <br id="r2l46">
            
            tion Gike the cant which it perceives) is a constant thing, and not, like the society <br id="r2l47">
            
            itself, for ever creating new modernities, for ever believing itself the latest thing <br id="r2l48">
            
            in freedom and chic. Wherefore, because Schnitzler, like the human nature he <br id="r2l49">
            
            knows so well, is always fundamentally the same, but his successive readers, <br id="r2l50">
            
            at ihe moments of his first impacts with them, are at various stages of callowness <br id="r2l51">
            
            or self-deception, his books have perpeiually either the tang of immorality orthe <br id="r2l52">
            
            flatness of dissipation. His work is a little startling to those who come freshly <br id="r2l53">
            
            to his art, seeing that to palates nurtured on the falsehood of successive conven¬ <br id="r2l54">
            
            tions nothing is so astringent as truth, and the taste for truth is a taste to be <br id="r2l55">
            
            acquired. But when he has done his duty, educated his readers, and they have <br id="r2l56">
            
            passed on to the exaggeration of cynicism which is not life but license, he is <br id="r2l57">
            
            liable to be scorned; for in their new zeal for eccentricity, folk forget that he <br id="r2l58">
            
            taught them reality and in their folly pass beyond the influence of his sanity <br id="r2l59">
            
            and realism. Such is the fate of truth—either to be too violent or too mild. <br id="r2l60">
