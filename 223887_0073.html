            Driver and the Enthusiastie Gentle¬ <br id="r2l19">

            the afternoon when Mr. Arliss re¬ <br id="r2l21">

            ting out of his cab at the entrance <br id="r2l24">

            tioned his companion and inquired: <br id="r2l26">
            
            Isn't that George Arliss?“ A gentle¬ <br id="r2l27">
            
            man who chanced to be passing <br id="r2l28">
            
            heard the question, stared hard at <br id="r2l29">
            
            Mr. Arliss d appeared to be startled <br id="r2l30">
            
            out of his wits. He repested the <br id="r2l31">
            
            actor’s name thrich, turned on his <br id="r2l32">
            
            heel and went careening down thei <br id="r2l33">
            
            street like a drunken man. <br id="r2l34">
            
            Mi. Arliss complained that he is <br id="r2l35">
            
            seldom permitted to indulge his fancy <br id="r2l36">
            
            for stopping before shop windows as <br id="r2l37">
            
            he walks aleng. He has had to end <br id="r2l38">
            
            this diversion almost entirely because <br id="r2l39">
            
            of the embarrassments which have <br id="r2l40">
            
            come to him while so occupied. <br id="r2l41">
            
            People will come up to him and open <br id="r2l42">
            
            up conversations, and he has to walk <br id="r2l43">
            
            away feeling that he’s been rude, <br id="r2l44">
            
            which he really hasn't. <br id="r2l45">
            
            One-of his joys is to steal into a <br id="r2l46">
            
            picture show where one of his films <br id="r2l47">
            
            is being shown and sit in with the <br id="r2l48">
            
            audience. <br id="r2l49">
            
            But sitting in the audience is a <br id="r2l50">
            
            great strain, too. Unless you have <br id="r2l51">
            
            high moral courage, which I have <br id="r2l52">
            
            not, you'll find it very depressing <br id="r2l53">
            
            hearing things that you don't want <br id="r2l54">
            
            to hear. You get the adverse critl¬ <br id="r2l55">
            
            cism out there and you can't do any¬ <br id="r2l56">
            
            thing about it. It’s rather a terrible! <br id="r2l57">
            
            feeling knowing that this thing is <br id="r2l58">
            
            going on and on, hundreds of times <br id="r2l59">
            
            in hundreds of theatres, and other <br id="r2l60">
            
            people will be saying the same thing <br id="r2l61">
            
            about it, and you can't stop the <br id="r2l62">
            
            picture.“ <br id="r2l63">
            
            Mr. Arliss has ideas about the talk¬ <br id="r2l64">
            
            ing pictures. He believes the current <br id="r2l65">
            
            notion of presenting a program so <br id="r2l66">
            
            diversified as to appeal in some <br id="r2l67">
            
            phase to every class of audience is <br id="r2l68">
            
            futlle. He sees no reason for##in¬ <br id="r2l69">
            
            congruous short subjects which are <br id="r2l70">
            
            tacked onto the program. He would <br id="r2l71">
            
            like to see the feature picture pro¬ <br id="r2l72">
