            Jew’s advancement in the State service <br id="r3l18">

            gone-who-knows the fäcts and feels the <br id="r3l24">
            
            situation is an event of the highest in¬ <br id="r3l25">
            
            terest. We can imagine the work, on <br id="r3l26">
            
            the part of Arthur Schnitzler, to be al¬ <br id="r3l27">
            
            most autobiographical. <br id="r3l28">
            
            But the mere treating of an interesting <br id="r3l29">
            
            thesis would by no means make a play. <br id="r3l30">
            
            Especially when, as in this piece, there <br id="r3l31">
            
            is not the slightest vestige of “love in¬ <br id="r3l32">
            
            terest,“ nor a single female character <br id="r3l33">
            
            except for a nurse who appears for a <br id="r3l34">
            
            few moments in the first act. The ped¬ <br id="r3l35">
            
            ants are perfectly right in saying that <br id="r3l36">
            
            discussion does not make drama. Such <br id="r3l37">
            
            a play as this demands one thing more. <br id="r3l38">
            
            That is character delineation and action, <br id="r3l39">
            
            ceaseless, rich, powerful. And this <br id="r3l40">
            
            Schnitzler has given us. Every charac¬ <br id="r3l41">
            
            ter in the the piece, and there are a great <br id="r3l42">
            
            many, is shown in his pecullar shade <br id="r3l43">
            
            of political belief, personal dogma and <br id="r3l44">
            
            temperament. There is Bernhardi him¬ <br id="r3l45">
            
            self, first of all a good physician, but <br id="r3l46">
            
            Umore man of the world than savant,“ <br id="r3l47">
            
            witty, balanced and capable, desiring <br id="r3l48">
            
            above all things to do his work and keep <br id="r3l49">
            
            out of musses. There are the pro¬ <br id="r3l50">
            
            nounced anti-semites (one of them à <br id="r3l51">
            
            Jew), and the men of the world who are <br id="r3l52">
            
            content to be pro-semites, so long as the <br id="r3l53">
            
            Jews make all desired concessions. There <br id="r3l54">
            
            are the more or less violent Jews and <br id="r3l55">
            
            the gentile pro-semites, one of the lat¬ <br id="r3l56">
            
            ter a delightful old doctor who has more <br id="r3l57">
            
            bile in the cause of justice than the most <br id="r3l58">
            
            violent Hebrew. And there is especially <br id="r3l59">
            
            one remarkable character, that of Flint, <br id="r3l60">
            
            the minister of public instruction, who sees <br id="r3l61">
            
            the question quite humanly and bears <br id="r3l62">
            
            the highest friendship towards Bern¬ <br id="r3l63">
            
            Through him the play drives into poli¬ <br id="r3l64">
            
            tics. And it is here, apparently, that <br id="r3l65">
            
            Schnitzler says ’what he has to say.“ <br id="r3l66">
            
            „ <br id="r3l67">
            
            Unfortunately,“ says Flint, since I <br id="r3l68">
            
            can't get along without the coöperation <br id="r3l69">
            
            of Parliament, I must make what men <br id="r3l70">
            
            call concessions. But you are wrong if <br id="r3l71">
            
            you think it is always an easy thing to <br id="r3l72">
            
            make concessions. Do you think it cost <br id="r3l73">
            
            me no sacrifice to let these people take <br id="r3l74">
            
            their revenge on my' old friend Bern¬ <br id="r3l75">
            
            hardi? And yet it was necessary. The <br id="r3l76">
            
            situation was for once clearly defined.“ <br id="r3l77">
            
            Tes, Excellence,“ replies his secretary, <br id="r3l78">
            
            Lit seems that when one is an official <br id="r3l79">
            
            one has only the chofce between being <br id="r3l80">
            
            an anarchist or a toady.“ <br id="r3l81">
            
            In this appears the only note of bitter¬ <br id="r3l82">
            
            ness, on the part of the author, in the# <br id="r3l83">
            
            whole play. Semitism has come to be ab <br id="r3l84">
            
            matter of politics, and in any sort of! <br id="r3l85">
            
            politics or administration one cannot be <br id="r3l86">
            
            one’s true self. It is a sort of secret of <br id="r3l87">
            
            the political boudoir that he is revealing, <br id="r3l88">
            
            a thing which the young men don't know <br id="r3l89">
            
            and the old men won't tell. <br id="r3l90">
            
            Bernhardi himself never becomes mere¬ <br id="r3l91">
            
            ly bitter, but falls into a sort of resigned <br id="r3l92">
            
            despair, coming to the conclusion (as so <br id="r3l93">
            
            often happens) that plays right into the# <br id="r3l94">
            
            hands of his opponents.“I feel, as per¬ <br id="r3l95">
            
            haps you feel,“ he says to the priest, who <br id="r3l96">
            
            returns to beg his pardon, "and never! <br id="r3l97">
            
            more intensely than in this hour, thatt <br id="r3l98">

            a mere cynic, but a serious thinker. And <br id="r3l107">
