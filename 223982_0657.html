            to be weary of what they have Just con¬ <br id="r3l24">

            at the same kind of card party. In <br id="r3l43">
            
            fact, it 1s Just because none of the ten <br id="r3l44">
            
            characters depicted is ever shown at a <br id="r3l45">
            
            card party that the play exlsts and <br id="r3l46">
            
            draws. Sex is interesting, as birth and <br id="r3l47">
            
            murder are. It seems expecting tco <br id="r3l48">
            
            much of it, though, to ask it, as Mr. <br id="r3l49">
            
            Schnitzler does, to “go it alone“ fora <br id="r3l50">
            
            whole play. <br id="r3l51">
            
            Naturally, Schnitzler not being an <br id="r3l52">
            
            American playwright or manager, no <br id="r3l53">

            ten it because he was an artist and <br id="r3l57">
            
            perhaps because he was young. <br id="r3l58">
            
            But it is difficult not to think less of <br id="r3l59">
            
            the Christlan-Sociallst Party here when <br id="r3l60">
            
            one reflects that their rlot was one which <br id="r3l61">
            
            was led astray. They had vo fine # <br id="r3l62">
            
            chance for a personal suppréssien. <br id="r3l63">
            
            Within the last week there have been <br id="r3l64">
            
            moments when it looked as though <br id="r3l65">
            
            Reigen might be brought to America. <br id="r3l66">

            sughly informed as to, the type of <br id="r3l70">
            
            play that needs personal suppression. <br id="r3l71">
            
            Reigen has been deserlbed as both <br id="r3l72">

            ticket for the next evening. <br id="r3l78">
            
            And both turned it down. One seemed <br id="r3l79">
            
            to think Shaw more shocking, and the <br id="r3l80">
