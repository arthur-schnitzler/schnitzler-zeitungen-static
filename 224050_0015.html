            eternal love and constancy with a comely ballet dancer <br id="r3l43">

             <br id="r3l45">
            
            mutually arranged that directly there was any “ cooling off: <br id="r3l46">
            
            on either side it should be frankly declared. Anatol had not <br id="r3l47">
            
            been in evidence more than two minutes before it was mado <br id="r3l48">
            
            plain that he had been false to Annie. How truo Annief <br id="r3l49">
            
            had been will presontly appenr. Anatol was giving a littlef <br id="r3l50">
            
            eupper. lt was to be a farewell one. He really could <br id="r3l51">
            
            not go on providing two suppers every evening—ono for <br id="r3l52">
            
            the lady ho wanted to bo on with and one for the <br id="r3l53">
            
            lady ho wanted to be off with. Anatol had brought in <br id="r3l54">
            
            bis friend Max to keep him in countenance while he broke to <br id="r3l55">
            
            Annie the dreadful news that they must part for over. Ho <br id="r3l56">
            
            dreaded her reproaches, and possibly he thought <br id="r3l57">
            
            Max Might Assist in Drying Her Tears. <br id="r3l58">
            
            When Annie arrived on the scone she was exceedingly hungry, <br id="r3l59">
            
            and certainly was not in zentimental mood. With her pretty <br id="r3l60">
            
            mouth nearly filled by an cyster, sho informed Anatol that ehe <br id="r3l61">
            
            had something very important to communicate. Anatol was in <br id="r3l62">
            
            aterrible hurry to know what it was. Annie took another oyster <br id="r3l63">
            
            and another pull atthe Burgundy. Soon, however, sbe laughingly <br id="r3l64">
            
            blurted out the avowal that ehe had fallen in love, and that <br id="r3l65">
            
            Anatol would have to find another sweotheart. Anatol was <br id="r3l66">
            
            not candid. He did not confess straight away that he had <br id="r3l67">
            
            another already. Anatol’s pride was hurt; his jealousy was <br id="r3l68">
            
            groused; hefilled the air with reproaches. Annie had another <br id="r3l69">
            
            bite and another drink, and went away. And I fancy Annie <br id="r3l70">
