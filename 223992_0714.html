            tenets of the aforesaid Continental school of <br id="r1l29">
            
            playwriting. Arthur Schnitzler, the author, is <br id="r1l30">
            
            one of the younger German dramatists, already <br id="r1l31">

            ular in Berlin and Vienna. It was done in Eng¬ <br id="r1l34">
            
            lish by the Progressive Stage Society on Feb. 19, <br id="r1l35">

            then as now. It is a complete translation, with <br id="r1l39">
            
            the vernacular of the original changed into Eng¬ <br id="r1l40">

            tail was published in Tnn Miknon at the time <br id="r1l42">
            
            of the first production. <br id="r1l43">
            
            Briefiy rehearsed, the story is this: Fritz <br id="r1l44">
            
            Sommer, a voung dragoon, carries on a flirtation <br id="r1l45">
            
            with Christine Wehring, the daughter of an old <br id="r1l46">
            
            violinist. Christine has fallen completely in love <br id="r1l47">
            
            with Fritz and innocently believes the young <br id="r1l48">
            
            man’s love for her is as complete. Fritz, how¬ <br id="r1l49">
            
            Tever, has a more serlous liasen with a married <br id="r1l50">
            
            woman about whom Christine knows nothing. <br id="r1l51">
            
            The husband of this woman discovers his wife's <br id="r1l52">
            
            infidelity and challenges Fritz. A duel is ar¬ <br id="r1l53">
            
            ranged and the young man is killed. Theodore, <br id="r1l54">
            
            his friend, tells Christine, but net until he has <br id="r1l55">
            
            told all of Fritz’s relatives; not until the young <br id="r1l56">
            
            man is buried, in fact. Christine then reallzes <br id="r1l57">
            
            how small a blace she held in her lover’s regard. <br id="r1l58">
            
            She demands to be taken to bis greve, and when <br id="r1l59">
            
            she is reminded that she may find another <br id="r1l60">
            
            woman praying there, she goes #lone to kill her¬ <br id="r1l61">
            
            self. Her old father, who nas understood her <br id="r1l62">
            
            and forgiven her, is left alone, ré#lizing that he, <br id="r1l63">
            
            too, has made a mistake. The philosophy of the <br id="r1l64">
            
            father is the“ eccentricity“ pertalning to mod¬ <br id="r1l65">
            
            ern Continental dramas. All his life he has <br id="r1l66">
            
            guarded from danger his dowerless sister, who <br id="r1l67">
            
            (Continued from page 3.) <br id="r1l68">
            
            died a virtnous, joyless spinster into whose life <br id="r1l69">
            
            no sort of happiness had ever come. When he <br id="r1l70">
            
            discovered his daughter’s liason with Fritz, long <br id="r1l71">
            
            before she told him, he determined that her light <br id="r1l72">
            
            should contain some Joy even at the cost of her <br id="r1l73">
            
            ingocence. The“ lesson“ of the dramatist linds <br id="r1l74">
            
            its exposition in the consequences of the father’s <br id="r1l75">
            
            philesophy as well as the tragedy of the daugh¬ <br id="r1l76">

            Both the individual acting and the“ team <br id="r1l78">
            
            plar,to use a sporting term, deserve the high¬ <br id="r1l79">
            
            Pest praise. Katherine Grey as Christine exhibits <br id="r1l80">
            
            unexpected emotional strength. During the first <br id="r1l81">
            
            act she indicates by her manner rather than her <br id="r1l82">
            
            speeches, Christine’s approaching disillusionment. <br id="r1l83">
            
            #ier scenes with Fritz in the second act are full <br id="r1l84">
            
            of spontancity, and her simulation of unselfish, <br id="r1l85">
            
            unreserved love is excellently done. In the last <br id="r1l86">
            
            art, however, Miss Grey rises to the highest type <br id="r1l87">
            
            of emotional acting—represssed passionate grief. <br id="r1l88">
            
            When Christine learns of Fritz’s death and as <br id="r1l89">
            
            the realization of her inferior place in his af¬ <br id="r1l90">
            
            Pfections comes to her with enmulative force, the <br id="r1l91">
            
            actress becomes almost terrible in the intensity <br id="r1l92">
            
            of her acting. <br id="r1l93">

            very good, though ner performance###fthe role <br id="r1l99">

            acter in less skillful hands might be made a cad <br id="r1l102">
            
            or worse, but as Mr. Dean plays it there is noth¬ <br id="r1l103">

            Robert Conness is well fitted with the part of <br id="r1l105">
            
            Theodore and plays it finelg. Albert Bruning <br id="r1l106">

            few moments during the ürst act. but his acting <br id="r1l108">
            
            is well nigh flawless. George Henrv Trader as <br id="r1l109">
            
            Christine’s father has an opportunity to show <br id="r1l110">
            
            what an artist he is in both acting and make-up. <br id="r1l111">
            
            It would be hard forthe most captions to lind <br id="r1l112">
            
            a fault in his work, even on the closest analysis. <br id="r1l113">
            
            The play is well staged, with evident care for <br id="r1l114">

            Ferick Sullivan and Gustave von Seyffer¬ <br id="r2l23">

            ried’s forces at the German Theatre for <br id="r2l25">
            
            eseveral years. With a meagre plot, scarce¬ <br id="r2l26">
            
            ly any semblance at all of a story, the# <br id="r2l27">
            
            play was skilfully handled by a company <br id="r2l28">
            
            Sof excellence. It is merely a tale of a <br id="r2l29">
            
            girl who loves above her station, to find <br id="r2l30">
            
            her hero involved in a love affair with a <br id="r2l31">
            
            married woman, subsequently being killed <br id="r2l32">
            
            in a duel with the husband. It is a play <br id="r2l33">
            
            where you have to draw a great deal upon <br id="r2l34">
            
            imagination, for in the first two acts <br id="r2l35">
            
            things move very slowly, and it is only <br id="r2l36">
            
            the distress of the young girl over her <br id="r2l37">
            
            lover’s actions, his hasty departure to <br id="r2l38">
            
            death, which made matters interesting in <br id="r2l39">
            
            the third act. <br id="r2l40">
            
            The story tells of two young bachelors, <br id="r2l41">
            
            who entertain a pair of young ladies in <br id="r2l42">
            
            their quarters. One of the girls is friv¬ <br id="r2l43">
            
            olous, the other is a sort of emotional <br id="r2l44">
            
            creature who is madly infatuated with <br id="r2l45">
            
            one young man who, while he professes <br id="r2l46">
            
            to be fond of her, has had an intrigue <br id="r2l47">
            
            with another woman. During a supper <br id="r2l48">
            
            party the husband of this woman arrives <br id="r2l49">
            
            and returns some letters, with the under¬ <br id="r2l50">
            
            standing that they are to meet upon the <br id="r2l51">
            
            field of honor. The ladies are sent home, <br id="r2l52">
            
            and this closes the first act. <br id="r2l53">
            
            The second act shows the quarters of <br id="r2l54">
            
            the heroine, where the story further pro¬ <br id="r2l55">
            
            gresses with no particular object, and the <br id="r2l56">
            
            third act is where things begin to hap¬ <br id="r2l57">
            
            pen. The end of all of it is a tale of too <br id="r2l58">
            
            much confidence in a scapegoat. Kather¬ <br id="r2l59">
            
            ine Grey, who played the heroine, had her <br id="r2l60">
            
            opportunity in this act, and developed as <br id="r2l61">
            
            an emotional actress of some quality. <br id="r2l62">
            
            Those who remember the strong scene she <br id="r2l63">
            
            had with W. H. Crane in Business is Busi¬ <br id="r2l64">

            this play, and she was rewarded with sev¬ <br id="r2l66">
            
            Veral curtain calls. John Dean, who has <br id="r2l67">

            Mr. Hunter is to be praised for staging <br id="r2l77">
            
            the play quite appropriately, considering <br id="r2l78">
