            is nearing the sixties; the prince is seven years <br id="r2l23">

            for Lolo Langhuber, the actress, with whom he <br id="r2l25">
            
            has had tender relations for years past, has <br id="r2l26">
            
            decided to settle down and marry, and the count, <br id="r2l27">
            
            awidower for manvyears, tells his old friend how <br id="r2l28">
            
            much he will feel the parting. The prince, also <br id="r2l29">
            
            a widower, has inchis turn a confidence to make, <br id="r2l30">
            
            much more startling. He has a son of seventeen <br id="r2l31">
            
            whom nobody has ever heard of, and has de¬ <br id="r2l32">
            
            eided that, the young man shall bear his name. <br id="r2l33">
