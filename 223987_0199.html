            lirlous moments and sees visions. She <br id="r1l85">

            sure, the sweetest and best of women. She <br id="r1l88">
            
            sees the rum soaked Mattern, who is always <br id="r1l89">
            
            beäting her. Besides the Angel of Dark¬ <br id="r1l90">

            kindness she has ever known is the kind¬ <br id="r1l92">

            resembles the good, kind Gottwold and <br id="r1l98">
            
            speaks like him. And the Angels of Light <br id="r1l99">
            
            sing to her of heaven. Death is beautiful, <br id="r1l100">
            
            and she wants to die. They bring her a <br id="r1l101">

            the Bride of thé Lord. Her poor little brain <br id="r1l105">
            
            is tangled up with memories of earthly <br id="r1l106">
