            well enough to picture it in a manner wholly convincing but who, <br id="r1l2">
            
            perhaps because of that imperfect knowledge, was able to ex¬ <br id="r1l3">
            
            press his passionate conviction that the bitterest of all thoughts <br id="r1l4">
            
            is the thought that one may be deprived of the opportunity of <br id="r1l5">
            
            knowing it. The sentence, uttered by one in the grip of such a <br id="r1l6">
            
            fear, which gives the key to the emotion of the piece is this: <br id="r1l7">
            
            *Only those who have much to remember lie quietly in their <br id="r1l8">
            
            graves'; and it is piainly the utterance of a man who possessed <br id="r1l9">
            
            the two qualities which make life seem most precious. He was <br id="r1l10">
            
            young and he was an artist. <br id="r1l11">
            
            The first act of the play is by far the best because it is the <br id="r1l12">
            
            simplest and rhe most clear cut. With a sense of reality never <br id="r1l13">
            
            recaptured during the succeeding two acts it presents the pie¬ <br id="r1l14">
            
            ture of a young girl chained to the bedside of a slowly dying <br id="r1l15">
            
            father and struggling between the artificial sense of duty to her <br id="r1l16">
            
            parent and the natural sense of her right to life. Without, the <br id="r1l17">
            
            noise of the passing throng summons her to a participation in <br id="r1l18">
            
            the experiences which seem in imagination so unutterably im¬ <br id="r1l19">
            
            portant; within, the old man, intuitively conscious of her strug¬ <br id="r1l20">
            
            gle, suggests with the logic of age that many years will remain <br id="r1l21">
            
            after he is dead; but to her it seems that if this one night <br id="r1l22">
            
            and the lover who awaits her is missed all l'fe will be missed, <br id="r1l23">
            
            and the author who understands the father with his head but <br id="r1l24">
            
            understands her with hir heart sends her to her adventure and <br id="r1l25">
            
            her lover. From then on, it must be confessed, the play grows <br id="r1l26">
            
            steadily less convincing as a picture of real life; the theme <br id="r1l27">
            
            pursued through various intricacies and reintroduced in new <br id="r1l28">
            
            surroundings becomes less and less sharply defined, and the <br id="r1l29">
            
            ineidents grow more and more thoatrical. Vet, withnlthe <br id="r1l30">
            
            theatricalism is of a not wholly unpleasant kind, for it is not <br id="r1l31">
            
            the result of insincerity and trickery but of a genuine feeling <br id="r1l32">
            
            which cannot quite adequately express itself; and thus, though <br id="r1l33">
            
            verisimilitude sometimes fails, the genuineness of the emotion is <br id="r1l34">
            
            always clearly and interestingly evident. <br id="r1l35">
            
            The author has nowhe.e actually thought his way through, <br id="r1l36">
            
            and his sincerity is not of a predominantly intellectual sort. <br id="r1l37">
            
            Because his conviction that the call of life is higher than the <br id="r1l38">
            
            call of duty is not the reasoned conclusion of a Nietzschean <br id="r1l39">
            
            philosopher but the instinctive protest of ardent youth against <br id="r1l40">
            
            all that stands between him and his imperious need for experi¬ <br id="r1l41">
            
            ence, he is capable even of a relenting conclusion which pays <br id="r1l42">
            
            the tribute of a perfunctory bow to conventional ideals of re¬ <br id="r1l43">
            
            morse and atonement; but for the same reason even its theatri¬ <br id="r1l44">
            
            calities are touched with poetic passion. Dudley Digges, who <br id="r1l45">
            
            directed the production for the Actors Theater, has, so it seems <br id="r1l46">
            
            to me, caught perfectly the spirit of the piece and wisely re¬ <br id="r1l47">
            
            frained from any attempt to pitch it in too realistic a key. He <br id="r1l48">
            
            has permitted the actors, among whom Eva Le Gallienne, Egon <br id="r1l49">
            
            Brecher, and Rosalind Fuller deserve especial praise, the slightly <br id="r1l50">
            
            romantic and the slightly theatrical gestures with which the <br id="r1l51">
            
            eager imagination of the author certainly endowed them, and <br id="r1l52">
            
            he has correctly assumed that in the play so presented the sin¬ <br id="r1l53">
            
            cerity of feeling would be evident behind the artificialities of <br id="r1l54">
            
            expression.“ The Call of Life“ remains one of those works, <br id="r1l55">
            
            rarer in the drama than in any other literary genre, whose very <br id="r1l56">
            
            imperfections constitute an interesting revelation of the mind <br id="r1l57">
            
            of the author. Certainly it is one of the plays of the season <br id="r1l58">
            
            most worth seeing. <br id="r1l59">
            
            The enterprising group at the Cherry Lane Theater has <br id="r1l60">
            
            undertaken a revival of the ballad-opera“ Polly'’ which John <br id="r1l61">
            
            Gay wrote as a sequel to his Beggar’s Opera.' Rowdy and in¬ <br id="r1l62">
            
            consequential like its predecessor, it has no song quite so famous <br id="r1l63">
            
            as“ could be happy with either were t’other dear charmer <br id="r1l64">
            
            away'' and no divertissement so excruciating as“ The Happy <br id="r1l65">
            
            Hen,? but it is made of the same stuff and inspired with the <br id="r1l66">
            
            same resistless flow of animal spirits. Its old tunes, now vehe¬ <br id="r1l67">
            
            ment with the boisterous merriment of the tavern and now <br id="r1l68">
            
            wistful with the far-away pathos of the folk ballad, recall in its <br id="r1l69">
            
            full vigor the life of a vanished age, and the rank flavor of its <br id="r1l70">
            
            cynical humor is as pungent as ever it was. <br id="r1l71">
            
            At the Schildkraut Theater in the Bronx Rudolph Schild¬ <br id="r1l72">
            
            kraut is acting in the original Viddish the fantastic comedy, <br id="r1l73">
            
            The Bronx Express,'' which once appeared briefly on Broad¬ <br id="r1l74">
            
            way. Its racily local humor can often be appreciated even by <br id="r1l75">
            
            those who, like myself, do not understand the language; the <br id="r1l76">
            
            dream scenes which require that the suggestion of a subway <br id="r1l77">
            
            car shall be always present are set with great ingenuity. Mr. <br id="r1l78">
            
            Schildkraut, as always, gives an excellent performance. <br id="r1l79">
            
            Stolen Fruit' (Eltinge Theater) is a highly emotional <br id="r1l80">
            
            play taken from the Italian and acted by Ann Harding and <br id="r1l81">
            
            Rollo Peters. In spite of an excellent performance it seemed <br id="r1l82">
            
            to me curiously unreal.“ The Crooked Friday' (Bijon Theater), <br id="r1l83">
            
            offered as a vehicle for the English actor Dennis Nielson-Terry, <br id="r1l84">
            
            put a yet severer and, indeed, insupportable strain upon credulity. <br id="r1l85">
