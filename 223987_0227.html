            a “rotter?' named Bill Higgins. She has <br id="r3l20">
            
            left her husband, unable to endure any <br id="r3l21">

            very rude—chivalry of Jim Harris’s <br id="r3l24">
            
            nature. He saves her from her husband’s <br id="r3l25">
            
            pursuit, and rapidly falls in love with <br id="r3l26">

            goes off to seek another lodging for the <br id="r3l30">
            
            night, her heart fails her, for she has <br id="r3l31">
            
            been“ brought up respectable.“ and she <br id="r3l32">
            
            returns home. <br id="r3l33">
            
            Her husband is not disinelined to accept <br id="r3l34">

            as though matters between them were to <br id="r3l36">
            
            be patched up. But his boding eoul tells <br id="r3l37">
            
            him that Jim Harris has been making <br id="r3l38">
            
            up to her.“ and in his drunken jealousy <br id="r3l39">
            
            he becomes s0 violent that once more she <br id="r3l40">
            
            leaves his house. Returning to Jim <br id="r3l41">
            
            Harris, she confesses her infirmity of pur¬ <br id="r3l42">
            
            pose, but indicates that she has now done <br id="r3l43">
            
            with her husband for ever. And here is <br id="r3l44">
            
            the point at which Mr. Harris’s charucter <br id="r3l45">
            
            develops in a wholly unexpected direction. <br id="r3l46">
            
            Though his conversation teeme with mono¬ <br id="r3l47">
            
            syllabie allusions to Hades and to the <br id="r3l48">
            
            digestive organs, and thongh his conduct <br id="r3l49">
            
            to his aged mother is the reverse of filial, <br id="r3l50">
            
            it now appears that he ie an intransigeant <br id="r3l51">
            
            idealist, with very exacting notions upon <br id="r3l52">
            
            various ethical questions. Hie confidence <br id="r3l53">
            
            in Mrs. Higgins is a good deal shaken <br id="r3l54">
            
            when he finds that abe intended to go <br id="r3l55">
            
            back on her word to him; and when she <br id="r3l56">
            
            confesses to having lied to her husband, <br id="r3l57">
            
            and denied that; he, Jim, had been! <br id="r3l58">
            
            making up to her,“ his moral indigna¬ <br id="r3l59">

            nothing to plead that she stoed in terror <br id="r3l61">
            
            of her life. His reply is,“ Well, yon've <br id="r3l62">
            
            got to die once, haven't yon?’’—and he <br id="r3l63">
            
            shows that he is no longer very keen on <br id="r3l64">
            
            associating with a woman who is capable <br id="r3l65">
            
            of such mean-spirited mendacity. <br id="r3l66">
            
            would be unfair to summarise in cold <br id="r3l67">
            
            blood the end of the play. To under¬ <br id="r3l68">
            
            stand it at all, we must follow in detail <br id="r3l69">
            
            the development of Jim’s character; and <br id="r3l70">
            
            chat is impossible unless one could quote <br id="r3l71">
            
            pages of dialogue. Even when we know <br id="r3l72">
            
            all that is to be known about him, I do <br id="r3l73">
            
            not think that his action is very compre¬ <br id="r3l74">
            
            hensible. Apart from its startling close, <br id="r3l75">
            
            however, ihe play is full of interest and <br id="r3l76">
            
            promise; and it is admirably acted by Mr. <br id="r3l77">
            
            Mekinnel as Jim. Mr. Edmond Breon as <br id="r3l78">

            it was produced by the Stage Society I <br id="r3l83">
            
            could eee nothing in it; but, finding <br id="r3l84">
            
            myself almost alone in that opinion, I <br id="r3l85">
            
            went to the Vandeville, hoping and even <br id="r3l86">
            
            expecting to revise it. In vain! The re¬ <br id="r3l87">
