            CLEM.—Spare yourself the pains. You don't have to use <br id="r1l29">
            
            body. I didn't bring out a book whenever a woman aban¬ <br id="r1l30">

            for it. <br id="r1l37">
            
            extremely coarse. It’s more degrading to me than if you <br id="r1l38">
            
            were to pose as a Greck goddess in flesh-colored tights at <br id="r1l39">

            a writer who makes copy of everything, goes beyond the <br id="r1l43">

            merely humorous. <br id="r1l45">

            MARG.—(Nervously.) Dearest, you forget that the poet <br id="r1l47">
            
            sisted in making tactless observations about the aristocracy. <br id="r1l48">
            
            does not always tell the truth. <br id="r1l49">

            CLEM.—And suppose he only vaporizes. Does that make <br id="r1l51">
            
            CLEM.—Nes. Of course, I don't feel called upon to make a <br id="r1l52">
            
            it any better? <br id="r1l53">
            
            brief for my class. Profligates crop up everywhere, even <br id="r1l54">
            
            MARG.—It isn't called vaporizing; it's distillation.“ <br id="r1l55">
            
            among writers, I understand. But, don't you know it was <br id="r1l56">
            
            CLEM.—What sort of an expression is that! <br id="r1l57">
            
            very bad taste on his part while one of us was present? <br id="r1l58">
            
            MARG.—We disclose things we never experienced, things <br id="r1l59">
            
            MARG.—That’s just like him. <br id="r1l60">
            
            we dreamed—plainly invented. <br id="r1l61">
            
            CLEM.—I had to hold myseif in check not to strike him. <br id="r1l62">
            
            CLEM.—Don't say “we' any more, Margaret. Thank good¬ <br id="r1l63">
            
            ness, that is past. <br id="r1l64">
            
            MARG.—In spite of that, he was quite interesting. And, <br id="r1l65">
            
            then, you mustn't forget he was raving jealous of you. <br id="r1l66">
            
            MARG.—Who knows? <br id="r1l67">
            
            CLEM.—What? <br id="r1l68">
            
            CLEM.—I thought I noticed that, too. (Pause.) <br id="r1l69">
            
            MARG.—Good heavens, they were all jealous of you. Nat¬ <br id="r1l70">
            
            MARG.— (Tenderly.) Clement, I must tell you all. <br id="r1l71">
            
            CLEM.—What is it? <br id="r1l72">
            
            urally enough—you were so unlike them. They all paid court <br id="r1l73">
            
            to me because I wouldn't discriminate in favor of any one <br id="r1l74">
            
            MARG.—It is not past; I haven't given up my writing. <br id="r1l75">
            
            CLEM.—Why? <br id="r1l76">
            
            of them. You certainly must have noticed that, eh? Why are <br id="r1l77">
            
            you laughing? <br id="r1l78">
            
            MARG.—I'm still going on with my writing, or, rather, I’ve <br id="r1l79">
            
            CLEM.—Comical—is no word for it! If some one had <br id="r1l80">
            
            finished writing another book. Yes, the impulse is stronger <br id="r1l81">
            
            prophesied to me that I was going to marry a regular fre¬ <br id="r1l82">
            
            than most people realize. I really believe I should have gone <br id="r1l83">
            
            quenter of the Café Maximilian—I fancied the two young <br id="r1l84">
            
            to pieces if it hadn't been for my writing. <br id="r1l85">
            
            CLEM.—What have you written now? <br id="r1l86">
            
            painters most. They’d have made an incomparable vaudeville <br id="r1l87">
            
            team. Do you know, they resembled each other so much and <br id="r1l88">
            
            MARG.—A novel. The weight was too heavy to be borne. <br id="r1l89">
            
            owned everything they possessed in common—and, if I'm not <br id="r1l90">
            
            It might have dragged me down—down. Until today, I tried <br id="r1l91">
            
            mistaken, the Russian on the ladder along with the rest. <br id="r1l92">
            
            to hide it from you, but it had to come out at last. Künigel <br id="r1l93">
            
            MARG.—I don't bother myself with such things. <br id="r1l94">
            
            is immensely taken with it. <br id="r1l95">
            
            CLEM.—Who's Künigel? <br id="r1l96">
            
            CLEM.—And, then, both must have been Jews? <br id="r1l97">
            
            MARG.—Why so? <br id="r1l98">
            
            MARG.—My publisher. <br id="r1l99">
            
            CLEM.—Then it’s been read already. <br id="r1l100">
            
            CLEM.—Oh, simply because they always jested in such a <br id="r1l101">
            
            MARG.—Ves, and lots more will read it. Clement, you <br id="r1l102">
            
            way. And their enunciation. <br id="r1l103">
            
            MARG.—Nou may spare your anti-Semitic remarks. <br id="r1l104">
            
            will have cause to be proud, believe me. <br id="r1l105">
            
            CLEM.—Now, sweetheart, don't be touchy. I know that <br id="r1l106">
            
            CLEM.—You're mistaken, my dear. I think—but, tell me, <br id="r1l107">
            
            what’s it about? <br id="r1l108">
            
            your blood is not untainted, and I have nothing whatever <br id="r1l109">
            
            MARG.—I can't tell you right off. The no#el contains the <br id="r1l110">
            
            against the Jews. I once had a tutor in Greek who was a Jew. <br id="r1l111">

            CLEM.—My compliments! <br id="r1l116">
            
            having made the acquaintance of your associates in Munich. <br id="r1l117">
