            ACTI. Huge, (26) Lulu (13), and their daughter Franziska, <br id="r1l11">
            
            live in a large town in comparative luxury. The plav opens <br id="r1l12">
            
            in Hugo’s room, a friend comes to fetch him, finding him <br id="r1l13">
            
            out enters into conversation with Lulu, they are soon joined <br id="r1l14">
            
            by the other members of the family, and by an aunt and <br id="r1l15">
            
            cousin of Hugo. He who is out riding becomes the subject <br id="r1l16">
            
            of conversation. They comment on his amiability and are <br id="r1l17">
            
            pleased that he is such a general favourite. Still it has been <br id="r1l18">
            
            noted by his people that of late he har appeared quiet and <br id="r1l19">
            
            absorbed, often as if his real life was led apart from them. <br id="r1l20">
            
            Especially has this impression been made on his aunt, his <br id="r1l21">
            
            former confidant, and on his cousin Agnes, who is deeply <br id="r1l22">
            
            attached to him. Afriend of the family, Dr. Schmidt, a man <br id="r1l23">
            
            risen from the masses, cold, unsympathetic, intending to <br id="r1l24">
            
            further improve his position by marrying Franziska, arrives <br id="r1l25">
            
            and makes some cynical remarks. At last the two girls are <br id="r1l26">
            
            left alone, from the window they see two carriages approach¬ <br id="r1l27">
            
            ing and bet on which will first pass their house. To their <br id="r1l28">
            
            surprise and dismay one of the carriages stops at their door, <br id="r1l29">
            
            and a man, whom they recognise as Hugo, is carried into the <br id="r1l30">
            
            house. He has been thrown from his horse and mortallz <br id="r1l31">
            
            injured. Feelirg how near death he is, still conscious, he <br id="r1l32">
            
            tells his mother that, not legally married, he has a wife and <br id="r1l33">
            
            son to whom he is devoted. He begs her to send for them, <br id="r1l34">
            
            that he may say farewell, and extracts her promise to <br id="r1l35">
            
            acknowledge them and allow them to live in the house after <br id="r1l36">
            
            his death. Hugo’s father, dismayed by the news and by his <br id="r1l37">
            
            wife’s promise, decides to fetch the wife and child himself. <br id="r1l38">
            
            The death scene where the relatives, the wife and child with <br id="r1l39">
            
            their varied emotions, the cold and cynical Dr. Schmidt <br id="r1l40">
            
            attending the patient, are all present, is most thrilling and <br id="r1l41">
            
            dramatic. Atthe end Hugo’s mother whispers to her dying <br id="r2l1">
            
            son:" Be at peace, my child; these two, your wife and child, <br id="r2l2">
            
            have found a home. <br id="r2l3">
            
            A week has elapsed since Hugo’s death; the family <br id="r2l4">
            
            ACT II. have accepted the situation, and Toni and her boy <br id="r2l5">
            
            are living in the house. The grand-parents love thechild and <br id="r2l6">
            
            do their utmost to gain his affection; and though not unkind <br id="r2l7">
            
            to Toni make her feel her position. Only Franzisk. and ihe <br id="r2l8">
            
            aunt Emma are really good to her; Agnes, stirred byher love <br id="r2l9">
            
            for Hugo, tries to make a friend of Toni, but jealousv and <br id="r2l10">
            
            conventionality stand in her way. Toni often speaks o“ her <br id="r2l11">
            
            past happiness, and she and Franziska visit the former home <br id="r2l12">
            
            of the happy trio together. <br id="r2l13">
            
            No friends of the family have visited since th. death of <br id="r2l14">
            
            the son, and they feel they are social outcasts in consequence <br id="r2l15">
            
            of the unconventional step they have taken. Dr. Schmidt <br id="r2l16">
            
            considers such action justifiable, and is much shocked that <br id="r2l17">
            
            Franziska has been allowed to go out with Toni. He is told <br id="r2l18">
            
            she is the mother of their grandchild and shares their home. <br id="r2l19">
            
            She retorts that they should have adopted the child, but <br id="r2l20">
            
            thrown over their son’s mistress. The husband of one of the <br id="r2l21">
            
            married friends is announced as a visitor, and the parents go <br id="r2l22">
            
            to receive him. Franziska returns touched bythe signs of love <br id="r2l23">
            
            and devotion she has seen in Hugo’s own home; Dr. Schmidt <br id="r2l24">
            
            reproves her for having gone there with Toni. He says <br id="r2l25">
            
            though friends will give them up, he will remain true to them <br id="r2l26">
            
            in consequence of his attachment to Franziska, whose hand <br id="r2l27">
            
            he asks in marriage. On the parents returning they report <br id="r2l28">
            
            that the friend has intimated that his wife and daughter can <br id="r2l29">
            
            no longer visit. Toni returns bringing photographs, amongst <br id="r2l30">
            
            them one of her late father. This Dr. Schmidt recognises <br id="r2l31">
            
            having attended him in his last illness, he died alone, his <br id="r2l32">
            
            daughter preferring to remain with her lover. Toni replies <br id="r2l33">
            
            that she wishedto visit her father after her union with Hugo, <br id="r2l34">
            
            but he had refused to see her. Suddenly from the ante-room <br id="r2l35">
            
            one hears the child cry for its mother, Toni goes and returns, <br id="r2l36">
            
            excitedly exclaiming that he seems very ill. The doctor and <br id="r2l37">
            
            the family rush in to the boy. Franziska is left alone, and <br id="r2l38">
            
            says:“ Oh, my God, Vou will not take little Franzi from us!“ <br id="r2l39">
            
            as the curtain falls. <br id="r2l40">
            
            The boy is dead. A heavy gloom seems to hang <br id="r2l41">
            
            ACT III. over everything. Franziska and Lulu are busy <br id="r2l42">
            
            packing up the child’s playthings during the mother’s absence. <br id="r2l43">
            
            She soon returns looking sad and ill, her only hope that as <br id="r2l44">
