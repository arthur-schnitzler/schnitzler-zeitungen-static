            There is, however, a vital difference between an honest attempt to relate <br id="r1l13">
            
            one'’s experiences to the larger consciousness of the race and the pervading <br id="r1l14">
            
            of personal affairs — even where they are partially cloaked. <br id="r1l15">
            
            The Bohemianism which was considered so essential to the success of <br id="r1l16">
            
            the artist during the last generation forms the background of the tragedy, <br id="r1l17">
            
            The Lonely Way' (03). Wegrath, a young painter, takes his friend <br id="r1l18">
            
            Fichtner to the village, where his sweetheart, Gabriele, lives. She falls <br id="r1l19">
            
            desperately in love with Fichtner, and the two decide to elope. Just <br id="r1l20">
            
            before the plan is to be carried out Fichtner’s ardor cools — his Bohemian <br id="r1l21">
            
            instincts assert themselves — and he deserts her. She now marries We¬ <br id="r1l22">
            
            grath, who in time becomes the director of the academyof fine arts. Gabriele <br id="r1l23">
            
            becomes the mother of two children, the older of whom, Felix, is the son of <br id="r1l24">
            
            Fichtner, as we may suppose. Fichtner, after some time, returns to <br id="r1l25">
            
            Vienna and associates with his old friends. As his life becomes more <br id="r1l26">
            
            lonesome he has a growing desire to enter into closer relations with his son. <br id="r1l27">
            
            His love affairs have not given him the inspiration for great work, and finally <br id="r1l28">
            
            he wanders about aimless and homeless. After Gabriele’s death he re¬ <br id="r1l29">
            
            turns again to Vienna and tries to claim his son by revealing the secret of <br id="r1l30">
            
            his parentage, but Felix remains true to the man who has bestowed love and <br id="r1l31">
            
            care upon him, and has provided for his mother. Von Sala, another char¬ <br id="r1l32">
            
            acter of the drama, is a cultured nobleman of the old school. He revels <br id="r1l33">
            
            in sensual, intellectual and esthetic pleasures without much compunction <br id="r1l34">
            
            for woes that he inflicts upon others. Less emotional and more intellectual <br id="r1l35">
            
            than Fichtner, von Sala analyzes his conduct and philosophizes about it. <br id="r1l36">
            
            Felix is representative of a new type. According to von Sala he has a proper <br id="r1l37">
            
            sense of the fitness of things. He may be less intellectual than the older <br id="r1l38">
            
            generation but he excels it in self-control. <br id="r1l39">
