            ARTHUR SCHNTTZLER <br id="r1l5">
            
            his wise man seem ridiculous. The erring wife and the betrayer <br id="r1l6">
            
            are portrayed with such subtle irony that no doubt of the author’s <br id="r1l7">
            
            intention can remain. His point of view clearly is that these relations <br id="r1l8">
            
            must be analyzed objectively and understood if they are to be outgrown <br id="r1l9">
            
            effectively. <br id="r1l10">
            
            Under the title of the last play of the series, three one-act dramas <br id="r1l11">
            
            Paracelsus,' The Companion,' and The Green Cockatoo,' were pub¬ <br id="r1l12">
            
            lished in °99. The motto of the book is: We are always playing; he who <br id="r1l13">
            
            knows it, is wise.' Each play gives an effective illustration of the impor¬ <br id="r1l14">
            
            tance of our illusions. The thesis of the book is put forward most clearly <br id="r1l15">
            
            in the first play. Theophrastus Hohenheim returns to his native city <br id="r1l16">
            
            Basel, after he has won fame as a wonder-working physician under the name <br id="r1l17">
            
            of Paracelsus. Ignoring the commonplace realities of life he forms an <br id="r1l18">
            
            interesting counterpart to Cyprian, the armorer of Basel, who is happy in <br id="r1l19">
            
            the possession of this world’s goods. Cyprian has a beautiful wife and <br id="r1l20">
            
            takes delight in the fact that he is able to protect her against her many <br id="r1l21">
            
            admirers. Although he knows of her carly love for Paracelsus, he brings <br id="r1l22">
            
            this man to his home. He further wounds the pride of Paracelsus by twit¬ <br id="r1l23">
            
            ting him with his apparent insignificance. Paracelsus proceeds to revaluate <br id="r1l24">
            
            values. He hypnotizes Cyprian’s wife and puts her under the suggestion <br id="r1l25">
            
            that she has been guilty of infidelity. When Cyprian's anger has been fully <br id="r1l26">
            
            aroused by this he changes the suggestion and commands her to speak the <br id="r1l27">
            
            absolute truth. She now relates that she had been in love with Paracelsus <br id="r1l28">
            
            and that she had married Cyprian because she desired a safe happiness. <br id="r1l29">
            
            She tells that she has outgrown her love for Paracelsus, but confesses that <br id="r1l30">
            
            she really had been sorely tempted by another man on that very day. <br id="r1l31">
            
            Cyprian is quite willing now to have the suggestion of absolute truthfulness <br id="r1l32">
            
            removed. He is content to live henceforth with illusions and promises <br id="r1l33">
            
            to do so in a more humble manner. <br id="r1l34">
            
            The Companion’ takes us into another world. Professor Robert Pil¬ <br id="r1l35">
            
            gram had married a woman much younger than himself, and had realized <br id="r1l36">
            
            that he had lost her affection. He consoles himself by devoting himself to <br id="r1l37">
            
            his profession with increased zeal and takes the matter philosophically. <br id="r1l38">
            
            He rcalizes that she is in love with Dr. Alfred Hausmann, his assistant, and <br id="r1l39">
            
            he feels certain that the time is not distant when she will insist upon a separa¬ <br id="r1l40">
            
            tion. The wife suddenly dies, and Robert is ready to meet Alfred as a <br id="r1l41">
            
            friend and console him, when he learns that this man is announcing his <br id="r1l42">
            
            engagement to another woman to whom he has been engaged secretly for <br id="r1l43">
            
            two years. Robert feels now that his wife has been degraded unspeakably. <br id="r1l44">
            
            Not until he learns that his wife had been informed of the nature of her <br id="r1l45">
            
            relations, does Robert realize the web of illusions in which he has been <br id="r1l46">
