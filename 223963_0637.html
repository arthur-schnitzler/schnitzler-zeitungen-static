            called Runt, has been punished in a <br id="r1l46">

            offence. The punishment is to last for <br id="r1l54">
            
            twenty-one days, but the Captain, a <br id="r1l55">

            Runt is found to be dead. The whole <br id="r1l61">
            
            play is appalling in its revelation of <br id="r1l62">
            
            inhumanity, so appalling, indeed, as to <br id="r1l63">

            suspect that his rage would be greatlg# <br id="r1l84">
            
            abated if the beating were done by a <br id="r1l85">
            
            Communist to a Nazi. Mr. Green <br id="r1l86">
            
            would feel as much compunction about <br id="r1l87">

            hot, but he is not spiteful. Until Mr. <br id="r1l90">
            
            Odets can clear his mind of party cant <br id="r1l91">
