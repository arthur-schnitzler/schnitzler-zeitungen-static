            bone and blood of the Viennes. But they <br id="tr_1_tl_17">
            
            no longer played with life. <br id="tr_1_tl_18">
            
            "You see, the city itself developed like <br id="tr_1_tl_19">
            
            a too fast growing child. In 1850 it was <br id="tr_1_tl_20">
            
            a comparatively small affair surrounded <br id="tr_1_tl_21">
            
            by a fortress. The Ring, which is now the <br id="tr_1_tl_22">
            
            main artery of the city, was then only <br id="tr_1_tl_23">
            
            country, a free place, a road. Why, as <br id="tr_1_tl_24">
            
            late as 1890 Marianifestrasse was a sub¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_25">
            
            urb. Today it is one of the busiest of <br id="tr_1_tl_26">
            
            Vienna's business streets. The city grew <br id="tr_1_tl_27">
            
            too fast for its small clothes. New de¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_28">
            
            mands were made on hearts to young to <br id="tr_1_tl_29">
            
            meet them. The result was worry, con¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_30">
            
            fusion, the punishments of life on all mis¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_31">
            
            takes of immaturity. From much of this <br id="tr_1_tl_32">
            
            Vienna has recovered. But it has not re¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_33">
            
            covered its unthinking youth, its untroub¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_34">
            
            led gayety. <br id="tr_1_tl_35">
            
            "You must remember that to begin with <br id="tr_1_tl_36">
            
            Vienna was not quite se light as the world <br id="tr_1_tl_37">
            
            imagines it." Dr. Schnitzler had con¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_38">
            
            stantly to retrace his characterizations. It <br id="tr_1_tl_39">
            
            was interesting to see in him the impulse <br id="tr_1_tl_40">
            
            to skich a character or a situation with <br id="tr_1_tl_41">
            
            a striking figure of speech, and to see that <br id="tr_1_tl_42">
            
            impulse overtaken, checked and corrected <br id="tr_1_tl_43">
            
            by the equally strong passion to present <br id="tr_1_tl_44">
            
            the same subject in all its fullness and <br id="tr_1_tl_45">
            
            complexity. Along with Strauss waltzes <br id="tr_1_tl_46">
            
            Vienna has produced steel and surgery <br id="tr_1_tl_47">
            
            and contributions to the science of crimi¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_48">
            
            nology and many other things the world <br id="tr_1_tl_49">
            
            would expect of our neighbors, the Ger¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_50">
            
            mans. We are always being compared to <br id="tr_1_tl_51">
            
            the Germans, or contrasted rather. Of <br id="tr_1_tl_52">
            
            course there is quite a striking difference <br id="tr_1_tl_53">
            
            but not between us and the Germans as a <br id="tr_1_tl_54">
            
            whole as between us and Prussia. Our <br id="tr_1_tl_55">
            
            immediate neighbors, the Germans of the <br id="tr_1_tl_56">
            
            south, of course blend in with our char¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_57">
            
            acter. <br id="tr_1_tl_58">
            
            In one respect Vienna has had a har¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_59">
            
            time growing up. It finds it hard to take <br id="tr_1_tl_60">
            
            itself or others seriously, particularly <br id="tr_1_tl_61">
            
            itself. North Germany, for example, has <br id="tr_1_tl_62">
            
            always found Vienna amusing. Well, our <br id="tr_1_tl_63">
            
            people took that as their cue too. It be¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_64">
            
            came the fashion for our correspondents <br id="tr_1_tl_65">
            
            to foreign newspapers to poke fun at <br id="tr_1_tl_66">
            
            everything Viennese. The result was <br id="tr_1_tl_67">
            
            that no native talent was prophetic among <br id="tr_1_tl_68">
            
            our people. Now there is a great deal of <br id="tr_1_tl_69">
            
            fine talent among them. But it has a hard <br id="tr_1_tl_70">
            
            time getting itself appreciated here until <br id="tr_1_tl_71">
            
            it has received approval abroad. Gustave <br id="tr_1_tl_72">
            
            Mahler found it so hundreds of others <br id="tr_1_tl_73">
            
            have had the same experience. Look at <br id="tr_1_tl_74">
            
            this, for example !" <br id="tr_1_tl_75">
            
            He took up from the desk a sketch in <br id="tr_1_tl_76">
            
            sepia crayon of a young woman's relaxed <br id="tr_1_tl_77">
            
            body. It seemed to me an astounding <br id="tr_1_tl_78">
            
            achievement. It was a matter of lines of <br id="tr_1_tl_79">
            
            crayon on paper. But they did not seem <br id="tr_1_tl_80">
            
            Immobile. Almost I looked for those lines <br id="tr_1_tl_81">
            
            to move lazily, flexing and turning with <br id="tr_1_tl_82">

            Yet Vienna has not opened its eyes to <br id="tr_1_tl_87">
            
            him; and will not, I suppose, until he re¬ <br id="tr_1_tl_88">

            pose Vienna is adolescent still; its char¬ <br id="tr_2_tl_6">
            
            acter is not yet formed; its inconsistencies <br id="tr_2_tl_7">
            
            still lie side by side, intact and unmodified, <br id="tr_2_tl_8">
            
            Or rather I should say that was the con¬ <br id="tr_2_tl_9">
            
            dition of affairs with us in 1914. Since <br id="tr_2_tl_10">
            
            then there have been fiery years, years in <br id="tr_2_tl_11">
            
            which the character of Vienna has aged <br id="tr_2_tl_12">
            
            many times six years. <br id="tr_2_tl_13">
