            this rather insignificant place. Anna Riedel, an orphan, has joined this <br id="r1l7">
            
            company in order to make a place for herself as an actress. Her talent <br id="r1l8">
            
            and general intelligence command respect, but she has not reckoned with <br id="r1l9">
            
            her environment. No one in the company expects her to maintain her <br id="r1l10">
            
            self-respect. The manager regrets that she has not become the object <br id="r1l11">
            
            of attentions from a number of the lascivious patrons of the place, for the <br id="r1l12">
            
            actresses that maintain such relations are profitable to him. Some of her <br id="r1l13">
            
            associates feel a certain contempt for her, others are angered at her supposed <br id="r1l14">
            
            superciliousness. She wins the respect of Paul Rönning, a wealthy young <br id="r1l15">
            
            man who has just recovered from a serious illness. Paul understands her <br id="r1l16">
            
            desperate situation, and tries to shield her. He has even offered her <br id="r1l17">
            
            financial assistance, but she has had the good sense to refuse it. Among <br id="r1l18">
            
            the guests is Lieutenant Karinski, a rake of the worst type. He is hope¬ <br id="r1l19">
            
            lessly involved in gambling debts and love affairs. Without provocation, <br id="r1l20">
            
            he has struck down a civilian and expects to be expelled from the service. <br id="r1l21">
            
            This man brags publicly that he can get Anna’s acceptance to an after¬ <br id="r1l22">
            
            theater lunch. He goes to her room and is not admitted. When his <br id="r1l23">
            
            failure is disclosed to the company, Paul cannot suppress a faint smile, <br id="r1l24">
            
            at which Karniski becomes incensed. Although Paul makes every possible <br id="r1l25">
            
            attempt to evade him, Karniski continues to grill him and besmirches <br id="r1l26">
            
            Anna’s character until Paul strikes him. The plain justice of Paul’s action <br id="r1l27">
            
            is admitted by every one present, including Karniski’s closest friends. <br id="r1l28">
            
            The military traditions of course call for a duel, but to the amazement of <br id="r1l29">
            
            Karniski's scconds, Paul flatly refuses to fight. After his illness he is in¬ <br id="r1l30">
            
            toxicated with the joy of being alive. He looks upon his act merely as a <br id="r1l31">
            
            just punishment for Karniski, but even his own seconds and his dearest <br id="r1l32">
            
            friends disagree with him. Every man of standing withdraws his hand <br id="r1l33">
            
            from him because he undertakes to violate such a sacred institution. Karn. <br id="r1l34">
            
            iski, according to the code, loses his honor and decides to avenge himself <br id="r1l35">
            
            upon Paul. Anna hears of the difficulty and hurries to Paul in order to <br id="r1l36">
            
            rescue him. Although she does not love him, she offers to go away with <br id="r1l37">
            
            him. Paul is warned, but resolutely refuses to flee and is killed by Karniski. <br id="r1l38">
            
            This satire is so convincing because the author has depicted the power <br id="r1l39">
            
            of an old institution over various types of ##n. Poldi Grehlinger, the <br id="r1l40">
            
            hidebound dandy of Vienna sporting circles, looks upon the code as the law <br id="r1l41">
            
            and the prophets. Even Dr. Wellner, a man of scientific training and <br id="r1l42">
            
            liberal in most matters, feels that social forms must give every man an <br id="r1l43">
            
            opportunity to protect his honor. <br id="r1l44">
            
            At this period (°96—97) ten dialogues were written which were subse¬ <br id="r1l45">
            
            quently published under the title of Roundels.' At a first glance the reader <br id="r1l46">
            
            wonders whether the author was ambitious to vie with Boccaccio, Rousseau, <br id="r1l47">
