            night with the most beautiful woman of Bologna. When he learns that <br id="r1l6">
            
            Beatrice is on the way to her marriage he refuses to interfere until he <br id="r1l7">
            
            perceives that she herself is wavering. She consents to follow the Duke <br id="r1l8">
            
            if he will make her his wife. This condition is granted, and Beatrice <br id="r1l9">
            
            receives a costly veil as a bridal gift. All of the fair ones of Bologna are <br id="r1l10">
            
            invited to the wedding, at the climax of which Beatrice disappears. She <br id="r1l11">
            
            goes back to Loschi and again declares her love. She consents to die with <br id="r1l12">
            
            him, but when Loschi actually takes poison she is controlled by the youthful <br id="r1l13">
            
            impulse to live — to live at any cost. With the excuse that she has been <br id="r1l14">
            
            praying in a chapel she returns to Lionardo, who discovers that she has <br id="r1l15">
            
            lost her veil. He threatens to kill her if she refuses to lead him to the place <br id="r1l16">
            
            where it has been lost. At first she refuses, but once more her love of mere <br id="r1l17">
            
            life dominates her. Lionardo at first is shocked when he sees that this <br id="r1l18">
            
            girl could forsake the poet whom he loved and adored above all other men <br id="r1l19">
            
            of Bologna. Beatrice implores him to kill her, and when he refuses to do so <br id="r1l20">
            
            Francesco, her brother, rises to the occasion, thus making good his early <br id="r1l21">
            
            resolutions. The gist of the tragedy is contained in Lionardo’s last words <br id="r1l22">
            
            to Beatrice: <br id="r1l23">
            
            Were you not but a child — 0 Beatrice, <br id="r1l24">
            
            That dallied with the crown because it glittered; <br id="r1l25">
            
            A poet’s soul because it held enigmas, <br id="r1l26">
            
            Ayoung man's heart — because a happy chance <br id="r1l27">
            
            Presented it to you? But we, too haughty, <br id="r1l28">
            
            Scorned what you did — and each of us desired <br id="r1l29">
            
            To be your only toy — nay more —to be <br id="r1l30">

            This book is a remarkably sympathetic analysis of the inner life of a woman. <br id="r1l34">
            
            In her youth Bertha attends a conservatory of music and falls in love with <br id="r1l35">
            
            ayoung musician. Her father takes her out of school and secretly informs <br id="r1l36">
            
            the young man that his attentions must cease. Later she marries Garlan, <br id="r1l37">
            
            a petty official in a provincial town. After three years of monotonous <br id="r1l38">
            
            married life, during which she gives birth to a son, Garlan dies. Bertha <br id="r1l39">
            
            spends three years of her widowhood in dull routine, rounding out her <br id="r1l40">
            
            modest income by giving music lessons. The advances made to the young <br id="r1l41">
            
            woman, who is still singularly beautiful, awaken her old dream of happi¬ <br id="r1l42">
            
            ness. She reads the announcements of her triumphs of the former lover, <br id="r1l43">
            
            who is to appear at a concert in Vienna, and addresses a note to him. He <br id="r1l44">
            
            invites her to a rendezvous, and she does what she had refused to do as a <br id="r1l45">
            
            girl — surrenders to him without resistance. Although she makes no <br id="r1l46">
