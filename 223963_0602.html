            Schnitzler was inspired by the example of <br id="r1l43">
            
            Shaw in The Doctor’s Dilemma, but the <br id="r1l44">
            
            relation between their plays is no closer than <br id="r1l45">
            
            that rach of them presents a gallery of portraits <br id="r1l46">
            
            of medical men. Moreover Schnitzter’s play <br id="r1l47">
            
            deals not ouly with a problem of medical <br id="r1l48">
            
            conduct, but with such a problem in its <br id="r1l49">

            victim of surgical malpractice. But she is in <br id="r1l55">
            
            a state which the doctor calls“ euphoria. <br id="r1l56">
            
            She is not merely unaware of her nearness to <br id="r1l57">
            
            death: indeed, she is under the happy illusion <br id="r1l58">
            
            that within the next hour somebody who is <br id="r1l59">
            
            dear to her will take her away from the <br id="r1l60">

            the nursing sister, unknown to her and to the <br id="r1l62">
            
            Professor, has sent for a priest to administer <br id="r1l63">
            
            the last unction. On the arrival of Father <br id="r1l64">
            
            Reder, the doctor refuses politely but firmly <br id="r1l65">
            
            to permit the priest to see the dying girl. <br id="r1l66">
            
            At the sight of him she would die in terror <br id="r1l67">
            
            instend of in peace. The priest urges that, <br id="r1l68">
            
            as asinner, she is in greater need of absolution <br id="r1l69">
            
            than many ancther Meanwhile, by a scarcely <br id="r1l70">
            
            noticeable flicker of an evelid, Father Reder <br id="r1l71">
            
            has sent the nurse into the ward and. while <br id="r1l72">
            
            he and Dr. Bernhardi are still arquing, the <br id="r1l73">
            
            sister returns to say that she told the <br id="r1l74">
            
            patient of the presence of the priest, and <br id="r1l75">
            
            reluctantly admits that this terrified her into <br id="r1l76">
            
            the knowiedge that death was at hand. <br id="r1l77">
            
            Scarcely has she spoken wlien another doctor <br id="r1l78">
            
            comes to say the patient is dead. Mr Huneker, <br id="r1l79">
            
            curiously enough, saw nothing dramatic in <br id="r1l80">
