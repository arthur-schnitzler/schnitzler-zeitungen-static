            first count of the word in ballet. Schnitzler, it is <br id="r1l68">
            
            true, provided in the original German text a running <br id="r1l69">
            
            commentary on the action in succinct, workmanlike <br id="r1l70">
            
            form which, nevertheless, has literary dignity and <br id="r1l71">
            
            variety if not reading valuc. He even indicates <br id="r1l72">
            
            snatches of speech corresponding to the action, a <br id="r1l73">
            
            phrase or a remark which he expects to be trans¬ <br id="r1l74">
            
            lated from dialogue into plastic expression, gesture <br id="r1l75">
            
            menn to the spectator anything whlich he brings to <br id="r2l1">
            
            it at the moment. Even a title is gratuitous. But <br id="r2l2">
            
            when the pantomime-ballet, the dance-drama, the <br id="r2l3">
            
            ballet with a story, emerged, it brought with it the <br id="r2l4">
            
            opportunity if not the necessity for the word, for <br id="r2l5">
            
            a literary résumé. In this sense, the pantomime¬ <br id="r2l6">
            
            ballet corresponds to program music. The practi¬ <br id="r2l7">
            
            tioners of the latter frequently find inspiration in <br id="r2l8">
            
            an already created work of literature—a pocm or <br id="r2l9">
            
            a passage of descriptive or narrative prose. If the <br id="r2l10">
            
            process is reversed, they are usually careful to pro¬ <br id="r2l11">
            
            vide the interpretive Pprogram'’ in a form worthy <br id="r2l12">
            
            of their own musical contribution. Such a “pro¬ <br id="r2l13">
            
            gram'’ is lacking in The Bridal Veil.? A single <br id="r2l14">
            
            inept and banal paragraph attempts lamely to do <br id="r2l15">
            
            duty for it. It is not too late to fill this gap in <br id="r2l16">
            
            an otherwise exquisite contribution to the season's <br id="r2l17">
            
            theatrical record. But it must be filled by a poet <br id="r2l18">
            
            or a master of lyric prose worthy of the collaborat¬ <br id="r2l19">
            
            ing author, composer, regisseur, and designer. <br id="r2l20">
            
            I have said that the pantomime-ballet brought <br id="r2l21">
            
            with it the opportunity or the necessity for the <br id="r2l22">
            
            word. I have purposely phrased the case thus alter¬ <br id="r2l23">
            
            natively. For I recognize the legitimacy of the <br id="r2l24">
            
            contention of the newer school of dance-dramatists <br id="r2l25">
            
            that the pantomime-ballet can and should be so self¬ <br id="r2l26">
            
            evident in its meaning as to need no interpretation <br id="r2l27">
            
            a kind of motion picture without sub-titles. I <br id="r2l28">
            
            venture to doubt, however, whether any but con¬ <br id="r2l29">
            
            noisseurs of the art can ever successfully waive this <br id="r2l30">
            
            literary key. And even were it possible to do so, <br id="r2l31">
            
            an appropriate “program'’ should be a pleasant and <br id="r2l32">
